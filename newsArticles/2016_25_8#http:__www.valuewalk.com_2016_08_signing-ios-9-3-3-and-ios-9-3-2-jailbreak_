On Wednesday, Apple stopped signing the iOS 9.3.3 and iOS 9.3.2 firmwares for compatible iPhones, iPads and the iPod Touch. If you have already upgraded to the latest iOS 9.3.4 or you’re still stuck on the iOS 9.3.1, you’ll no longer be able to upgrade or downgrade to the iOS 9.3.2 and 9.3.3 using iTunes. A signing closure shouldn’t be a big deal, but this one indeed is for those looking to jailbreak their devices. Apple’s move has effectively blocked Pangu’s jailbreak for the iOS 9.3.3 and 9.3.2.The Cupertino company released the iOS 9.3.4 earlier this month, fixing the bug that China-based Pangu had exploited to jailbreak the iOS 9.3.3 and 9.3.2. Apple had rightly credited Pangu for discovering (and then exploiting) the bug. The iOS 9.3.2 was pushed out in June with the ability to use the Night Shift in Low Power Mode. The 9.3.3 version was a maintenance update fixing a vulnerability that allowed hackers to collect sensitive information with a text message.Even though Apple had released the iOS 9.3.4 on August 4, it kept signing the 9.3.3 and 9.3.2 versions for about three weeks. It gave users a chance to downgrade and jailbreak their devices. Though a few experts have teased iOS 9.3.4 jailbreaks, they are unlikely to release their tools to the public. There is no jailbreak tool currently available to the public for the iOS 9.3.4.Should we expect an iOS 9.3.4 jailbreak anytime soon? Probably not. The iOS 10 release is just a few weeks away, so Pangu or any other team is unlikely to release a 9.3.4 jailbreak. Even if they have identified a bug in iOS 9.3.4 that can be exploited, they would prefer to see if the same exploit can be used to jailbreak the upcoming iOS 10. So, don’t expect a new jailbreak until the iOS 10 is out. If you are currently on iOS 9.3.3 or 9.3.2, avoid upgrading to the 9.3.4 because there is no going back.
