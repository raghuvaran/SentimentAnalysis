Rumors about the iPhone 6S will soon be put to rest. For now, we have one piece of the puzzle, which is the unveiling date. Apple has just emailed major media outlets to invite them to an event on Sept. 9 at 10 a.m. Pacific. This is consistent with what we heard earlier this month.The event is set for the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco, which is a much larger venue than where Apple usually hosts its events. Also the company has not previously held any events at that venue, which can hold up to 7,000 people.In the past, the company has held events at the auditorium located at its Cupertino, Calif. headquarters and at the Flint Performing Arts Center, also in Cupertino. The Flint Center only holds 2,400 people, and the Yerba Buena Center, where Apple has also held past iPhone unveiling events, only hold 1,470 people.Last year’s iPhone 6 and 6 Plus unveilings were held at the Flint Center on Sept. 9, 2014.The massive size of the venue suggests Apple has something big planned. Of course the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus are expected to make an appearance. It’s widely believed that the two new smartphones will have the Force Touch technology, which Apple introduced in the Apple Watch and the newest MacBook.The two new phones are also expected to have Apple’s A9 chips, some improvements on the main camera (possibly a boost up to 12 megapixels and with 4K shooting capability), a forward-facing flash, 1080p resolution on the front-facing selfie camera, and a casing made from the same 7000 series aluminum casing that was used for the Apple Watch. There have also been some images which suggest the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S plus could support moving wallpapers like what the Apple Watch offers.The media invites include the headline: “Hey Siri, give us a hint.” Apple Insider suggests this is a reference to the new set-top Apple TV box the company is expected to show off with the iPhone 6S. The new Apple TV is widely believed to have Siri incorporated into it. Also the box is rumored to have a redesigned touchpad controller and its own dedicated App Store for third-party apps.There have been murmurs also that Apple has been working on a streaming TV service to go along with that new Apple TV box. However, we’ve been hearing over the last few months that Apple has been struggling to strike deals with networks and content providers, which means this service may not make it into the lineup of the big event.Other gadgets that could possibly make an appearance at the iPhone 6S event in a couple of weeks is that rumored iPad Pro, which could measure up to 12 or 13 inches in size.As of this writing, shares of Apple were up 3.06% at 113.05 per share.
