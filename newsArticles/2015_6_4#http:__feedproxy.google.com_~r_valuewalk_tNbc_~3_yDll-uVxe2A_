Apple Watch is one of the most anticipated devices of the year. It will be Apple’s first new product under the leadership of Tim Cook. A large number of companies have already launched their smartwatches, but the segment hasn’t yet reached the tipping point. Apple properly unveiled its wearable device at an event on March 9.The Watch comes in three variants: Apple Watch Sport, standard Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition. Each will be available in two size options: 38mm and 42mm. The entry-level Apple Watch Sport features an aluminum casing. It has been priced at $349 for 38mm and $399 for 42mm version. The regular stainless steel Watch starts at $549 and goes up to $1,049 depending on which band you choose. The 42mm regular Apple Watch begins at $599.And then there is the ultra-premium 18-carat gold Apple Watch Edition. Its price starts at $10,000 and goes all the way up to $17,000. Apple CEO Tim Cook has said that the Watch Edition supply will be limited.The Cupertino tech giant will start taking pre-orders for the Watch at 12:01 a.m. PT on April 10 through the Apple Store. It will be available in stores in nine countries on April 24. The iPhone maker told Shara Tibken of CNet that you can’t line up outside an Apple Store and buy the Watch on April 24 or after the launch day. You’ll have to reserve the device of your choice online for in-store pick-up.It may be Apple’s way to manage the supply issues. The company has said in the past that Watch would be available in limited quantities, at least initially. However, Apple won’t be able to launch the device in Switzerland until December this year due to patent issues. A patent owned by a Swiss watch brand owner William Longe prohibits the Cupertino company from using the word or image of an apple to promote any of its products in the watch category. The patent is set to expire on December 5.Tim Cook claims that the Watch offers a “whole day’s battery life.” The Watch’s battery should last 18 hours under moderate usage, according to Apple. The 18-hour battery life claimed by Apple assumes “90 time checks, 90 notifications, 45 minutes of app use and a 30-minute workout with music playback from Apple Watch via Bluetooth.”So, heavy users may get a little less battery life, while it may last even five days for those who don’t use it that often. Thankfully, Apple offers a nifty magnetic charging cable that makes it easy to charge the Watch.The market is crowded with wearable devices. But Apple Watch is unlikely to face any competition from Android vendors. Instead, it may spell doom for others. The Watch hasn’t even hit the stores and it has already started taking a toll on rivals. On Monday, Citigroup analysts downgraded Garmin stock to Sell rating, citing the potential threat from Apple Watch.
