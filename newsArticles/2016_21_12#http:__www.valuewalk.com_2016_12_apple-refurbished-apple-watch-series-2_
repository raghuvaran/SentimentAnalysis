Apple has started offering refurbished Apple Watch Series 1 and Series 2 models via its online refurbished store. It’s the first time the tech giant is selling its wearable device in refurbished conditions since its release in 2015. The refurbished section of Apple’s online store includes both the Series 1 and Series 2 models at 14% to 16% off the price of new units depending on the configuration.You won’t find the original Series 0 Apple Watch there. All the refurbished Watch units listed in the store come only with Sport bands. However, interested buyers have the option to choose from stainless steel or aluminum cases in 38mm and 42mm size options.Refurbished devices are not technically new, but they are tested and certified by the company. The refurbished Apple Watch comes with a one-year warranty, free shipping, and free returns. The Cupertino company repairs the returned items to the point that they are “like new” and sells them at a discounted price. In some cases, the refurbished devices might not even have been used by the original customers.You can buy the Apple Watch Series 1 Sport for as low as $229 for 38mm model. The 42mm version costs $249. The Apple Watch Series 2 starts at $309 for 38mm and goes up to $339 for the 42mm model. The 38mm refurbished stainless steel model starts at $469 and the 42mm model costs $509. Apple’s discounts aren’t huge. You can find better deals elsewhere such as Target.The refurbished stock may vary on a day-to-day basis. All the refurbished Watch devices include magnetic charging cables, but only the Series 2 model ships with a power adapter. Both the Series 1 and Series 2 Watch models sport a faster dual-core processor. The Series 2 also boasts of a brighter display, built-in GPS, and increased water resistance.Sources told Cult of Mac that it has become “nearly impossible” to buy the Apple Watch Series 2 ahead of Christmas. Apple employees told the publication that Series 2 has witnessed a massive surge in demand since last month. Apple can’t keep up with the demand. It’s not worth waiting in line before stores open because most of the new shipments are for people who have placed orders online weeks ago.If you go to Apple’s online store, you’ll find that shipping times of the regular as well as Nike+ Apple Watch Series 2 have been pushed back to January. Consumers can still get the Series 1, but additional features in Series 2 have made it one of the most popular gifts this year. Apple has also been promoting the Apple Watch Series 2 as “The Gift of Go.”Apple never revealed the official sales numbers for the Apple Watch. Research firm IDC predicted the smartwatch sales to slow this year as fitness trackers gained momentum. However, Apple chief executive Tim Cook recently told Reuters that the Watch sales growth had been “off the charts.”
