The Apple Pay website has a section dedicated to businesses, and it has now been updated by the company with a new link that allows retail stores to order Apple Pay decals. A few weeks ago, the company added a set of Apple Pay graphics to the site for the merchants, and those will accompany the new decals.Apple Pay (with new logo kits) is something all businesses, small or medium or large, are being encouraged to adopt by Apple. The iPhone maker has a full page dedicated to businesses comfortable with the payment method.The new link automatically redirects merchants to a new Apple Pay Supplies website to order decals. The merchants become eligible for a free Apple Pay kit on signing up with the new website. The kit contains two glass decals of different sizes, register decals of two different sizes and an application tool as well.The online tool can be used for placing an order for a maximum of five kits, while for ordering larger decals, businesses need to make a phone call to Apple. Once details like company name, email address, and shipping address are entered by the business, they can obtain the kit at no cost.The Apple Pay logo was made available for download earlier this month. Along with it, the company provided a PDF that serves as a guide to users on how the payment mark is to be used. Apple mentioned in the document that the Apple Pay logo should be placed ahead of the marks from other payment services such as MasterCard and Visa.Retailers have been adopting Apple’s payment service at a fast pace with several new partners such as GameStop, Marriott International, Jamba Juice, JetBlue, Office Max, Regal Cinemas, Walt Disney World, and more joining in March. As revealed by CEO Tim Cook at the March 9 event, Apple Pay is accepted at more than 700,000 locations, including vending machines. The availability of Apple Pay will expand to a large number of business owners once a new Square reader with NFC connectivity is introduced.
