If the rumor mill is to be believed, the next iteration of the Apple Watch is going to arrive alongside the iPhone 7. Evan Blass of VentureBeat has learned from his sources that Apple would start taking pre-orders for the iPhone 7 on Sept.9, followed by its launch on Sept.16. Now a report coming out of Asia claims that the Apple Watch 2 will feature a new display technology that could free up some space that can be used to reduce its thickness or add some new functionality.Citing Apple supplier TPK Holding, Digitimes reports that the Apple Watch 2 will sport a “One Glass Solution” display instead of the Glass-on-Glass technology used in the current Apple Watch. The traditional Glass-on-Glass display features two pieces of glass, but the new technology eliminates one of the layers. It could also help reduce the weight of the device.TPK Holding added that the production of One Glass Solution panels is facing unexpected technical issues. As a result, the yield rates have been much lower than expected. It’s not yet clear whether the technical issues would affect the initial supply of the Apple Watch 2. Recent reports suggest that the new Watch won’t bring any major design changes.The Apple Watch 2 is expected to run watchOS 3 that was announced at the WWDC in June. The new wearable device would carry only minor design changes as there will be mostly under-the-hood improvements. Rumor has it that the next-gen Apple Watch would feature an LTE chip for cellular connectivity, a FaceTime camera, a new GPS chip, and an improved battery life.Apple was reportedly working to switch from OLED screens to Micro LED displays to enhance the color gamut and improve the battery life. But the switch is unlikely to take place before 2017.
