Apple’s much awaited Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) is all set to begin on Monday, June 8th at Moscone Center, San Francisco. For those who can’t attend the WWDC live for some reason, the iPhone maker has decided to live stream the event. Exactly a week before the event kicks off, the tech giant updated the Events channel on Apple TV, letting users know that the set-top box will have access to a live stream of the event.The Cupertino company is yet to update the events page on its website that usually hosts live streaming of events. But Apple is widely expected to stream the event on its website as well. WWDC 2015 will begin at 10:00 AM Pacific time on June 8th. You can watch the event live on your Mac, iOS devices or Apple TV. But there are a few conditions.The event will be available for streaming only on second- and third-generation Apple TVs with software 6.2 or later. To watch it on iPhones or iPads, you should have Safari on iOs 6.0 or later. Live streaming video on Macs would require Safari 6.0.5 or later on OS X v10.8.5 or later. A companion app will give Apple Watch users access to lab location details and session schedules.
