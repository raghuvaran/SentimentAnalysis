Apple isn’t the only tech company rumored to be working on a larger tablet. A new report from SamMobile suggests Samsung is working on an 18.4-inch Android tablet. The tablet is code-named Tahoe, and it could feature a TFT LCD display with 1920 x 1080 resolution, 2GB of RAM, 32GB of internal storage, an 8-megapixel front-facing camera and a 1.6 GHz processor.SamMobile reports that the exact measurements will be 451.88mm by 275.8mm with a thickness of 11.8mm. It will reportedly come with a 5,700 mAh battery, which is rather small for such a device. Previous rumors suggested Samsung was working on a bigger tablet, but no launch date has been suggested yet.Like the purported Apple iPad Pro, which is rumored to measure 12 inches, the larger Samsung tablet is expected to be targeted at business customers. There is already one similar device on the market called the Panasonic Toughpad, a 20-inch rugged tablet that was made for sharing presentations or bringing large displays on the move. Lenovo also offers a giant tablet called the IdeaCenter Horizon with a 27-inch screen and a bundle of gaming apps, including poker and virtual air hockey.There are also rumors of Samsung working on tablet with Windows 10. This tablet is rumored to feature a 12-inch HD display, 4GB of RAM, a 13nm Intel Core M chipset and an S Pen. Samsung previously offered Windows-based tablets under the name of Ativ, but it’s been awhile since a new Ativ tablet was released.The recent Samsung Windows tablet rumors come right after Microsoft introduced the new operating system last month. There is a possibility Microsoft will urge OEM partners to come up with fresh products. Of course the reports and rumors remain unconfirmed as the tech companies fail to provide answers.
