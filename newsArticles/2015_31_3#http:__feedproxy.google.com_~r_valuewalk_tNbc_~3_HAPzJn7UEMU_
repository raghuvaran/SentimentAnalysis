Apple has expanded its trade-in program, which now allows prospective buyers to exchange their non-Apple devices too, both smartphones and PCs, according to a report from 9to5 Mac. The extended program is a good opportunity for users who are willing to go for an Apple device but are afraid of the high pricing of the products.Apple said the trade-in program will accept devices from the majority of Android manufacturers like Samsung, Sony, Nokia, LG, HTC and so on. BlackBerry devices are also included in the trade-in program.Apple stores in the U.S., the U.K., Canada and some other European nations have updated their pages with the update to the reuse and recycle initiative. Apple’s third-party partners are responsible for operating the trade-in program, so non-Apple devices will be of interest to them.In August 2013, Apple came up with the Reuse and Recycling Program, which up until now was limited to iPhones, iPads and Macs. The new trade-in program can be utilized online and in-store. Users willing to take advantage of the program can mail their non-Apple smartphones to get benefits in the form of an Apple Store gift card or bank transfer.The largest numbers of customers across the world use devices running on the Android platform with a very small percentage using devices running on the Windows platform. Several of them are willing to upgrade to Apple devices, but probably due to the high prices, they are not able to. Hence, the program offers good incentives to switchers.For some reason if a device is not accepted for exchange under the trade-in program, then such customers will be offered help by Apple for recycling. This might happen in those cases in which the device is either too old or not in a usable condition.What’s included for a PC trade-in could differ from one country to another, primarily because Apple has different partners for different regions. Apple’s trade-in program is already live in many countries, including the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Germany, France and Italy.
