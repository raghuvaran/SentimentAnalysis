Apple has openly admitted that iPhone sales would decline in the March quarter.Um believes that Apple could sell around 82.2 million iPhone handsets over the holiday period.

There will be a conference call at 5 PM Eastern, 2 PM Pacific with the company’s executive team.Wells Fargo kept its “outperform” rating for Apple stock and set a valuation range of $120-130.The Apple iPhone 7 is expected to bring a raft of improvements over its predecessor, the iPhone 6s. The new smartphone is widely slated for release in September this year.Excitement is growing over a number of innovations, including a rumored dual-camera system that could bring dramatic improvements in performance in low light. Another persistent rumor involves the possible removal of the 3.5mm headphone jack, which would make the introduction of wireless headphones a necessity.Less sexy improvements such as better battery life have also been rumored. The existing iPhone 6s has come in for criticism due to its mediocre battery life, and users complain that they have to charge the smartphone at every opportunity to avoid running out of juice.According to other rumors the new Apple smartphone could also use a smaller version of the screen that was recently introduced on the iPad Pro. The LCD unit has a number of features that have made critics purr, and many people believe that it is the best screen to be found on any phone or tablet today.
