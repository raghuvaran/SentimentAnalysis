HMD Global the company given the rights to bring the Nokia Brand back to the masses is off to a great start. It’s Nokia 6 sold out within seconds in China, and now the rumors of a Nokia P1 have everyone excited! But, with rumors everywhere, and questions going unanswered how much, when, what features, and at what price, will it be?You’ve probably already guessed it, right now there’s no official information available about price. However, as the handset is expected to be a flagship, it could be around the same price as others. The rumors doing the rounds on this subject suggest the two possible variant prices will be between $800 and $950. With the price, you pay determined by the internal storage option you choose.According to those who know, HMD Global has secured itself a place at this year’s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. It’s at this event between February 27th and March 2nd that it’s believed the Nokia P1 will be announced. As for an ultimate launch date, that detail is speculated to be as soon as March 21st. Again there has been no official information seen which backs that date up.As with all pre-announcement smartphone speculation, there are many contradicting sources of information around. So with that in mind, we’ve chosen to be a little conservative in what we share with you.However, it goes without saying that if the Nokia P1 is to be a flagship Android smartphone. It will be the most powerful handset to have ever carried the Nokia Brand name. To back this train of thought up, it’s rumored that it will be powered by the Snapdragon 835. And that CPU is Qualcomm’s very latest and most powerful to date, something which the Galaxy S8 will also feature.Backing up the 835 will be 6GB of RAM, which when combined will help to create a lightning fast smartphone. One that if these two features are real will be able to match 2017’s other top smartphones.As for screen size, the jury is still out on what HMD Global may deliver, however somewhere between 5.3 and 5.5-inches is feasible. As for resolution, QHD is likely, and a coating of Corning’s Gorilla Glass 5 for protection is possible. Moving onto the already hinted at internal storage options rumors suggest there will be two on offer. Starting at 128gb and culminating at 256gb, however, as you know HMD Global has said nothing. So, take this information with a pinch of salt!One piece of information that isn’t required officially is the OS the Nokia P1 will run on. As it’s already known it will be the first Nokia handset to run on Android straight out of the box. Running on Android Nougat, users will be able to get the best security, multi-window apps, and everything else!Camera-wise, an old partnership will be reformed, which will see Carl-Zeiss again provide the optics for the handset. Details concerning its specs are a little sketchy, but a 22.6MP sensor for the rear camera is expected.As for charging HMD has decided (according to rumor)to equip the P1 with a USB-Type C port. Additionally, no following in Apple’s footsteps is on the cards, as the 3.5mm headphones jack will ake an appearance.So, there you have it, everything that is rumored so far! We have to say that with possible specs and features that good, how well the Nokia P1 sells may come down to Brand awareness. Having said that, we don’t know how deep HMD Global’s pockets are when it comes to marketing. However, when it comes to competing against the likes of Apple, and Samsung deep pockets are a requirement.
