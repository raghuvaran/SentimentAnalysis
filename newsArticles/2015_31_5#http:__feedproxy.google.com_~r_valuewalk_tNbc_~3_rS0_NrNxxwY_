Some commentators believe that Apple is already developing artificial intelligence.One believer is Jonny Evans of Computerworld, who sets out his case online. According to Evans there is a growing body of evidence which suggests that Cupertino is in fact working on artificial intelligence as part of “the digital transformation of pervasive technology embedded within every interaction and device.”First of all Evans points out the existence of huge server farms with matching renewable energy farms, as well as an increasingly close relationship with IBM and Watson. Furthermore there is the company’s growing connected health network, and the acquisition of augmented reality firm Metaio this week.All of these points, as well as the recruitment of robotics expert John Morell from Yale in 2012, would appear to suggest that Apple is interested in developing artificial intelligence.A quick search of Apple’s job vacancies reveals that there are at least 23 advertised roles which have “Artificial Intelligence” in the job description. Recent reports that Cupertino is working on an intelligent context-based solution known as “Proactive,” which is more powerful than Google Now but offers better privacy protection, is seen as further evidence of the development of artificial intelligence solutions driven by big data.The ethical issues that arise due to the development of artificial intelligence are sure to become a major concern worldwide in the coming decades. Harnessing the potential of technology for the benefit of humans without negatively impacting our way of life has been a constant concern throughout history.The advent of artificial intelligence which is smarter than the humans that created it is the stuff of science fiction, but we appear to be moving closer to the day that such a scenario becomes reality.
