A recently filed patent shows how tech giant Apple could make its devices impervious to water, and the iPhone 7 could be the first to receive the waterproof treatment.The patent relates to a system that will make the device power down after sensors detect that it has come into contact with water. According to the United States Patent & Trademark Office, a patent has been granted to Apple.The iPhone 7 is subject to a huge number of rumors in the lead up to its predicted launch in September. One such rumor relates to the fact that the new smartphone will be waterproof, a feature that many users would appreciate.The patent outlines one way that this could be possible. The newly patented system would shut down certain components when it detects water, to prevent any damage. This should give the owner of the device enough time to get to an Apple Store for repairs.Employees will then be able to make repairs based on the information given by the sensors. They will be able to communicate to the employee whether or not the device can be fixed.There are other smartphones on the market that already boast water protection. The Samsung Galaxy S7 has an IP68 rating, which makes it waterproof and dustproof, however Apple has fallen behind in this particular area.The waterproofing of the iPhone 7 could potentially be aided by the rumored removal of the 3.5mm headphone jack. Other rumors include the addition of wireless charging capabilities that would allow the Lightning port to be used for headphones. Another possibility is the addition of wireless Bluetooth earbuds.Apple fans have criticized the proposed move as it would obligate people to invest in new accessories. Music lovers have also pointed out that wireless headphones generally offer lesser sound quality than their wired cousins.Analysts predict that the iPhone 7 will look largely similar to the iPhone 6s. However we could see the removal of the antenna lines, and a camera that sits flush with the rest of the phone.It is rumored that this camera may be a dual-camera system that would be able to perform much better in low light. The proposed system would reportedly combine images captured by both lenses in order to make a sharper final image.There are rumors that this dual-camera system could only be available on the larger iPhone 7 Plus, in an attempt to drive sales of the bigger handset. Another possibility is that Apple decides to introduce a halo model, known as the iPhone 7 Pro, which would be the only one to boast the new camera.Another rumor relates to the display unit that could be used on the iPhone 7. Reports suggest that Apple may use a smaller version of the LCD display found on the iPad Pro.Reviews suggest that this screen is even better than the OLED display found on Samsung’s flagship smartphones. Apple itself is expected to switch to OLED displays in 2017, but it looks like it may have found a way to beat Samsung to the title of best screen even before that date.As it stands these are all just rumors so it’s best to take everything you read with a pinch of salt. Apple has not made any official announcements about the iPhone 7.
