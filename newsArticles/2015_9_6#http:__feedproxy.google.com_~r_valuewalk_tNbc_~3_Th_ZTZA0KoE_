Apple officially unveiled its new Apple Music service on Monday, but music industry executives don’t believe it will change the industry. A few unnamed executives opened up to The Verge to talk about the service. Although they believe the new service will catch on with music fans, they don’t think it’s likely to transform the industry. The new streaming service is designed to compete with popular services like Pandora and Spotify, but it offers something more.The Apple Music service will allow subscribers to stream most of the music in the iTunes library with some exceptions, as not every song is available. The service also combines music already purchased by the user with saved music for an expanded collection. The service also features an impressive search engine that makes finding specific artists or songs a breeze. Perhaps the best thing about the new music service is Siri integration. The voice-activated assistant helps locate and play songs. It also offers music recommendations.The new Apple Music service also comes with a radio station called Beats 1, and it will broadcast in over 100 countries. It also features disc jockeys from London, New York City and Los Angeles. The global station will also include interviews and other extras.Since social media is everything, Apple only thought it would be fitting to add social features to its music service. Artists and bands can set up a page where they can share music, videos, photos and more with fans.Apple music executive Jimmy Iovine believes the Beats 1 radio station has a strong advantage over competitors as the music selections are curated by actual people rather than algorithms. Beats 1 radio is free to stream, but Apple’s on-demand music service starts at $10 a month. The service is set to launch June 30.
