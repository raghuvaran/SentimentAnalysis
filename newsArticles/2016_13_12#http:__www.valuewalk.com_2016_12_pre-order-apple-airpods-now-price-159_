After the launch of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus dramatically killed the headphone jack, Apple assured us that everything would be okay due to it being courageous and announcing its AirPods for $159. However, with availability setbacks lasting for months, it was no surprise that some wondered if they’d ever be able to buy them. However, today we can inform you that the Apple AirPods have gone on sale.After months of delays, you can finally get a pair of these 21st century wireless marvels and, when they are delivered, quickly pair them with your iPhone 7 and 7 Plus to become a next-gen audiophile.The problem is, however, that the longer it takes you to hear this news, the less likely there will be any left. Apple is notorious for providing a limited amount of stock for the initial launch of products, so why would the Apple AirPods be any different?If you want to buy the AirPods soon, like before Christmas, visit Apple’s online store. The company has indicated that it will be able to ship the wireless headphones to you by December 21 in the U.S. It may also be possible for some customers to receive theirs as early as December 19. However, this is purely based on a first come, first served basis.The Apple AirPods are truly wireless headphones; there are no wires at all. The two earpieces have independent batteries and communicate with an iPhone independently.As for their audio performance, they are no competition for a set of Bang & Olufsen headphones, but according to Gizmodo, they do sound “surprisingly good” and are almost a world apart in audio quality when compared to the standard Apple headphones previously delivered with iPhones.Featuring Apple’s W1 technology, the AirPods can seamlessly pair with all iOS devices, including the latest handsets, the Apple Watch, and iPads.The actual act of pairing has been given some serious work, meaning that it is automatic, with the earpieces syncing over iCloud so that Apple devices can detect them. In fact, the syncing process begins as soon as you take the AirPods out of their box, as each piece identifies a nearby device and will appear on its screen.The Apple AirPods are the third product to feature the W1 technology, with the Beats Powerbeats 3 and Beats Solo 3 also having it.However, Apple has boldly envisioned a future with the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus which is truly wireless. Delays which were rumored to be due to manufacturing issues have delayed the start of this future, leaving owners of the 3.5mm headphones jack-less handsets scrambling to find alternatives and ways around it.Will you be rushing over to the Apple Store to get your AirPods? If you haven’t decided yet, don’t worry. They will be available in Apple retail stores next week.
