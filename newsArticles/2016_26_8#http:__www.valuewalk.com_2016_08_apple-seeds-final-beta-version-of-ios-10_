With Apple’s September 7th event just around the corner, hype is reaching fever pitch. With the Cupertino-based tech giant expected to unveil several new devices, such as the new iPhone 7 and Apple Watch, as well as the newest version of tvOS and iOS 10, the event is sure to be an important and exciting one. In the days leading up to the event, a select few are now able to test the newest beta of Apple’s mobile operating software, iOS 10.Apple today seeded the eighth beta of iOS 10 to developers and public beta testers for testing purposes, one week after the company released the seventh beta, and more than two months after the first unveiling of the new operating system at its 2016 Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC).The iOS 10 beta is now available as an over-the-air download for those of us who’ve installed the first seven betas or the beta configuration profile. For developers, it’s available as a direct download via Apple’s Developer Center.The highly-anticipated and hyped iOS 10 is a major iOS update which will certainly feature a ton of new, as well as improved, features, in addition to design tweaks. The update will include a new Lock screen experience with 3D Touch-enabled notifications, a more easily accessible camera, a redesigned Control Center, and a brand-new widgets screen. According to Apple, the upcoming iOS 10 is the company’s biggest iOS update they’ve ever released.The Messages application within iOS 10 has undergone a complete overhaul, including new features like background animations, Digital Touch, bubble effects, Tapback replies, predictive emojis, and handwritten notes. The new Photos application has new facial and object recognition features as well as a Memories feature for rediscovering forgotten photos.While the iOS 10 beta is currently only available to developers and public testers, the upgraded mobile operating system will most likely see a full public release this September, most likely alongside the release of the iPhone 7. iOS 10 beta 8 is most likely the final beta update before the master version is officially launched, as Apple will need a bit of time to work out the final software.
