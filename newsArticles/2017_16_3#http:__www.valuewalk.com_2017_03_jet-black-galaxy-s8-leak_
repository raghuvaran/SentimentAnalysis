Last year there was considerable hype surrounding Apple’s two iPhone 7 models and the fact that they both had a Jet Black variant. In fact, the hype was so prominent that it forced Samsung’s hand and in December 2016 it released a Jet Black version of its Galaxy S7 handset. Which was high praise for Apple’s designers, however, it may do it again with a Jet Black Galaxy S8. For which leaked images have made their way to the web.Earlier this month pictures were leaked of the Galaxy S8 and S8+ wearing the popular Apple Color Jet Black. However, now in what seems like a bid to confirm this possible move by Samsung unofficially, new images have arrived. The again shows the Jet Black Galaxy S8 and S8+, however, this time they appear to dummies. Meaning, they are not real devices, Instead, those just those used for display. As recent as yesterday a video came to light, which revealed what looked like a dummy Galaxy S8 to the iPhone 7 plus.The above video, while showing a dummy/mock-up Galaxy S8 does reveal how small the handset is even with a 5.8-inch display. In fact, the iPhone 7 Plus looks slightly bigger even with a smaller display. Of course, this can be attributed to the smaller bezels on the S8.In answer to the above question, we don’t know, however, the use of dummies is not unusual. They appeared before both the iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 releases and other devices over the past few years. As for the accuracy compared to the final product, this Jet Black Galaxy S8 is thought to have been created using real specs.Meaning that the actual schematics of the real device were used to construct it. Apparently, none of this can be independently verified, but the rumors state that the schematics were obtained from a factory. One that is working with Samsung to develop/manufacture the Galaxy S8. A such, it’s being reported that this dummy is as the Jet Black Galaxy S8 will look!With not long to go until the possibility of a Jet Black Galaxy S8 being announced alongside its S8+ counterpart. It’s needless to say that the rumor mill is rife with different opinions on what we will see. However, of the many that are doing the rounds, the following seems to have gained a consensus.It’s widely accepted that the smaller S8 will have a 5.8-inch display and the larger S8+ 6.2-inches. However, some are also pointing to a huge surprise when it comes to the resolution of those displays.Apparently, Samsung may equip both devices with 4K resolution, which will be made possible thanks to the use of a Curved Super AMOLED panel. However, is this really, the big bonus many rumor mongers would have us believe it is? We doubt it is, after all, with Google’s Daydream VR platform coming to Android handsets. It’s possible a resolution of this magnitude was always the plan.It’s no surprise that rumors are talking about Samsung using Qualcomm’s most powerful and latest chipset in the S8. It’s the most powerful chipset on the market and will help with VR’s power hungriness. That being said, if you’re outside of the United Sates, you’re more likely to get the device with an Exynos 8895. How it will perform when confronted with Google Daydream, we don’t yet know.Will 2017 see Samsung adopt 64GB internal storage as its new minimum? Rumors suggest it will be, along with 128GB and 256GB for the more space hungry. Additionally, there’s some talk about MicroSD support for up to 2TB cards, if this is accurate, we will just have to wait and see.As for RAM, falling short in this category in 2017 could leave the Jet Black Galaxy S8 or indeed any other of its variations at risk of being surpassed. Why? Because many of Samsung’s competitors will incorporate 6GB this year and feature Qualcomm‘s latest chipset the 835. Both of which when together will make for a potent combination, as such, Samsung is being urged to use a minimum of 6GB.
