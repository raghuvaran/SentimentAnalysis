BlackBerry is not wasting any time and appears all set to release a new model of its traditional keyboard handsets within a six-month period. This smartphone will be called the BlackBerry Mercury. The rumored smartphone, which was spotted recently at Geekbench and came with a model code BBB100-1, looks competent enough on paper to take on biggies like the iPhone and Pixel.Blackberry has already released two Android smartphones, the Priv and the DTEK50. There are rumors that the new smartphone by the Waterloo-based company will feature 3GB of RAM, which can stand up to the iPhone 7’s 2GB of RAM and the Google Pixel’s 4GB of RAM, notes GamenGuide.Previously, Phone Arena reported that the Mercury could be a mid-range alternative handset, feature-wise. However, it is not certain that the new handset will run Android 7.0 Nougat because, according to GSM Arena, 4GB of RAM is needed to run it, whereas the Mercury is expected to have only 3GB of RAM.Right now the list of handsets that run the latest Android OS is short: the LG V20 and Google Pixel/ Pixel XL. But whether or not the Mercury will run the operating system, many people still consider it a mid-range smartphone with great features, notes GamenGuide.Based on its expected price, this new BlackBerry device is far ahead in the game in comparison to the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus’ RAM and memory capacity. BlackBerry’s new model is expected to be powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor and come with 32GB of internal memory.Whether the new Blackberry smartphone will sport the trademark QWERTY keyboard that the smartphone maker is most popular for is something else we are not certain about. But it’s likely that it will come with the trademark physical keyboard, as it has a 4.5-inch display.In other BlackBerry news, the Canadian firm has updated its website to reflect that updates for the unlocked AT&T Priv units, which use a non-AT&T SIM card, will be managed directly by BlackBerry. In fact, the Waterloo-based company has begun rolling out the updates, notes GSM Arena.In the resolution section of the article related to the problem, the website says the over-the-air software update has been made available now. The website says that one has to tap the available software update within the Notification shade to get the update.
