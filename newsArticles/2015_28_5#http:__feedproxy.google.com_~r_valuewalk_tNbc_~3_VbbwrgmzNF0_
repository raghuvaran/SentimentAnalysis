Apple is looking to introduce a new reward program for Apple Pay at WWDC next month, claims The New York Times. By introducing the reward program, Apple will be filling in a missing piece which analysts believe is significant in retaining users and participating merchants.Available details suggest that the company is planning to offer perks to customers who make purchases through Apple Pay. The report suggested that the company will fill in details related to upcoming Apple Pay updates at its Worldwide Developers Conference in June. Those familiar with Apple’s plan said that next month, the company will announce a program giving perks to consumers who make purchases with the service, not revealing any other details.Reports and rumors about Apple’s reward program have continued to flow since Apple Pay was launched in October of 2014. In September, a report stated that the Cupertino, Calif.-based company is looking to partner with multiple third-party retailers to form an Apple Pay loyalty program. Rumors are doing the rounds that the company could tie into iAd, delivering targeted ads to consumers through iBeacons and Bluetooth LE with coupons for free or discounted products.Apple Pay competitor CurrentC has a built-in rewards program that offers loyalty cards and discounts for individual merchants, and CurrentC executives are promoting this as one of the major differentiating features of the system. However, if Apple launches its own rewards program, it will be in a better position with the reward-based features of CurrentC.As of now, there is no confirmation on if Apple will launch any additional features for Apple Pay at the conference, but during the event, the company could share details on an expansion of the service to additional countries such as Canada. After the U.S., Canada could be the next country to get Apple Pay.Apart from Apple Pay, the company is working on various updates for the iOS 9. The Cupertino, Calif.-based company is working on a new music streaming service based on its acquisition of Beats Electronics, a new Home app for managing home automation accessories, and a revamped look for iPhones and iPads with the new San Francisco typeface along with new security and optimization features, iPad split screen apps, a new keyboard and tweaked features for iMessage.
