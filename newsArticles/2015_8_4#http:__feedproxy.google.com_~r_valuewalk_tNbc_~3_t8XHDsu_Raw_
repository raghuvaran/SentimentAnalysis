The Apple Watch, which will be available soon, will not be an easy piece to get your hands on. It is not going to be a cakewalk for prospective buyers as they need to get a reservation first and follow a few other restrictions put in place by the company.Preorders for the watch will start soon, but those interested in buying one will have to undergo a tough reservation policy that will not allow buyers to reserve more than one Apple Watch per person, according to MacRumors. The report suggested that previously the iPhone maker thought of allowing two watches on one reservation but changed it to one owing to inventory issues.Compared to other devices, Apple is supposedly more conservative on selling watch units, probably because of limited stock. In its memo, the company said that inventory is subject to change. Also if a user fails to pick up an order from a specific Apple retail store at a set time and date, then the reservation is subject to cancellation, and the item will be returned in the stock.Apple claims the authority to refuse, limit or cancel a reservation if the company comes to know that the customer has provided misleading or fraudulent information and/ or abused, disrupted or attempted to circumvent the reservation system, says the memo obtained by the publication. Those interested in buying an Apple Watch should produce a valid government ID at Apple retail stores, and the watch will be given only to the person whose name is listed on the reservation portal.Even before the start of preorders, the coveted watch has been spotted on various occasions. A couple of days ago, Pharrel Williams was spotted wearing the Gold Edition model of the watch, while Tim Cook wore the device to the NCAA championship game.Also an Instagram user reportedly published the first images of the device’s box. The images have been posted by a user living in New York, showing the box for a 42mm stainless steel Apple Watch with the Milanese Loop band. The picture is believed to have been given to the U.K. newspaper the Daily Mail.
