A new research study from Crowd Flower offers some insight into the popularity of the Apple Watch. The interesting study showed overall interest and thoughts on the new wearable. It also showed how women and men view the new smartwatch differently and what it means for the future of the device.The study shows women appear to like the Apple Watch more than men do. This finding is interesting, especially considering last month’s article from The Telegraph that falsely predicted women would not like the Apple Watch much because they don’t wear watches very often. That didn’t stop Apple from spending a significant amount of money to market the device to the fashion-conscious market.Researchers also found both men and women have lowered their sentiments a little since Apple’s chief executive officer first introduced the device last year. Further the study shows men are the most obsessed with the new watch. In fact, 70% of all tweets about the watch come from men. The finding includes both positive and negative reactions. This finding is most surprising considering the majority of Twitter users are females.The vast majority of tweets about the Apple Watch involved apps. There were tweets about good apps, bad apps and apps with bugs in them. There were also a lot of tweets about the many fitness and health-related apps. Over half the app-related tweets were positive. Not surprisingly, most Apple Watch users loved the fitness apps, but they also enjoyed other apps that enabled them to do things like purchase coffee or present boarding passes with their watch.The negative tweets about Apple Watch apps involved factors like selection and app performance. Negative reactions tended to vary more than positive reactions.If the Crowd Flower study is accurate, perhaps men are just more likely to share their opinions about tech products on social media.
