Nike, one of the world’s leading sportswear companies, has announced a complete rebranding of its popular Nike+ Running app. The mobile app is now called the Nike + Run Club app. While the app gets some new performance features and visual and stability improvements, it’s the hint that it could work with watchOS and an Apple wearable with GPS, which can only be the Apple Watch 2, that has caused a stir!Visually, the app has been completely redesigned. Users now have access to information much faster than before, like run time, distance and location. Furthermore, there are more options to share what a user has been doing with their friends, which will likely lead to some friendly competition and increased motivation.Nike is heavily invested in the use of this app for the Apple Watch. This comes as it is being rumored that Apple could announce its next iteration, the Apple Watch 2, as early as September 7, but the consensus is that it will be later in the year.The current version of Nike’s app on the Apple Watch tracks pace, distance, elevation, heart rate and mile splits. However, the Apple Watch 2 is rumored to feature GPS, which would mean users could go for a run without the need of an iPhone and still be able to track their distance traveled and other useful pieces of information. If the Apple Watch 2 rumors are correct, it would mean the watch would be able to do work that previously required two devices and, as such, lighten the load for the user.This update from Nike also offers a selection of new personalized coaching plans. Nike suggests that the plans are meant to change as a user becomes fitter.The company said: “Whatever your goal, your Nike+ Coach has a plan for you. One that STARTS with your goals and fitness LEVEL, and ADAPTS as you progress,”As for what is offered and what has changed in the new app, the changelog below has the details.Welcome to Nike+ Run Club The Nike+ Running app is now the Nike+ Run Club app with a fresh, new & improved look.According to Fast Company, Apple has purchased a personal health startup called Gliimpse, which could mean that the Apple Watch 2 may be more of a fitness/health-based wearable than its predecessor.In response to the report on Fast Company’s website, the company responded with the usual statement: “Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans,”At the time of writing this article, there was nothing on Gliimpse’s website about Apple’s purchase. However, the company has firm goals set in place concerning people’s health and how it feels the masses of data that is accumulated should be managed.Gliimpse’s Linkedin page states that it believes in “making it easier for individuals to collate and share their own health data in simple, easily shareable formats,” It also states: “By unlocking hospital silos, we aggregate fragmented data into Medicare-mandated patient summaries. Gliimpse is your personal health history in the palm of your hand.”It is being rumored that the Apple Watch 2 will take this a step further following suggestions from industry insiders that the device will have an improved battery life that will make it easier to add more sensors to track and collect health data.Source: 9to5mac / fastcompany
