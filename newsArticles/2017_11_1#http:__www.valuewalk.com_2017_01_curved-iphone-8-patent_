We’ve heard multiple times that the iPhone 8 could feature curved sides, even as recently as last month. But one survey suggests that Apple fans might not want that. Apparently, they prefer the brick-like feel, but when has Apple ever opted for what fans want? Instead, it manages to brainwash people into accepting whatever changes it wants to make, such as removing the headphone jack.There’s also a new patent which suggests that Apple could one day put holes in the iPhone’s display. Although we would argue that it’s probably too early to expect this technology in this year’s models, there could be two potential use for it, both of which are features Apple has been rumored to be working on for some time.9to5 Mac conducted a poll recently to find out whether Apple fans would prefer an iPhone 8 with curved edges over one with flat sides. The tech site reports that 53% of its readers said they would prefer an iPhone 8 with flat sides, while only 37% said they would like the phone to have curved sides. So it seems clear why keeping the same form factor for years has been working for the company. Its fans just aren’t in favor of change, but then who is?So Samsung has forged ahead with its curved-display line, the Edge series, while Apple has played it safe, and fans say they like the safe approach.Some of 9to5 Mac’s readers suggested a third option, which involves a combination of the two. It seems the iPhone maker could excite some by giving the iPhone 8 flatter sides and rounded corners, “like a nice cross between the current design and the 5 series,” one respondent suggested. It seems the goal of the suggestions is to make the phone easier to pick up by rounding the edges of the corners.The tech world regularly reviews patents to get a clue as to what Apple might be planning for future devices, and one such patent suggests that one day, the iPhone could have holes in it. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued Apple a patent entitled “Electronic devices having displays with openings.”The patent describes a display on a device with one or more openings in it and electronic components mounted inside the openings. Among the components suggested as being mounted in the openings are a camera, light sensor, status indicator lights, “light-based touch sensor array,” or even a “secondary display that has display pixels that may be viewed through the openings.” Other suggestions are speakers, microphones or other components.“One or more openings in the display may form a window through which a user of the device may view an external object,” the patent adds. “Display pixels in the window region may be used in forming a heads-up display.”The reference to a heads-up display probably paves the way for augmented reality—something Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook has expressed interest in multiple times.This certainly sounds like some space-age tech that’s too advanced for the iPhone 8. However, this patent could have some implications for this year’s lineup because Apple could potentially use it for a feature it has been rumored to be working on for some time.If you’ve been following news about the iPhone 8, you’ve probably heard that the company may remove the Home button and then embed the Touch ID fingerprint scanner right into the display. The reports of an edge-to-edge display on a future iPhone could also point directly to the tech described in this patent. It describes a method for components to be embedded into a display, which would be needed if either of these two rumors are going to be fulfilled.
