A woman confronted White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer at an Apple Store over the weekend and then shared a video of the conversation on social media. Shree Chauhan was born in New York, and she’s of Indian descent. She asked Spicer what it’s like to work for “a fascist” (referring to President Donald Trump) and demanded that he tell her something about Russia.In the video, Chauhan, berates Sean Spicer with questions and never gives him a chance to say much of anything. It’s one question after another with little chance to give any sort of answer. The few words he did manage to get in edgewise were admittedly not a good thing to say.It’s difficult to hear in the video, but apparently, he told her, “Such a great country that allows you to be here.”Asking @PressSec questions in Apple Store since he doesn’t like the press. https://t.co/l493z2gG4x— Shree ?????? (@shreec) March 11, 2017 She took it as a threat to her citizenship, and many others support her viewpoint. Others see a less ominous view when his words are taken at face value without reading anything into them. It’s difficult to imagine what to say when someone runs up at you in public and starts shouting endless questions at you. At best, most people would probably come up with a lame response because they’re taken by surprise, and at worst, they say something someone would take the wrong way.Anyone who opposes the Trump administration feels that they now have more ammunition. His comment clearly sounds ominous to immigrants and those with family members or close friends who are immigrants, especially in the wake of the President’s infamous Muslim ban, new immigration and deportation rules, and plans to build a wall along the border with Mexico.Unfortunately, her post on social media invited mostly comments expressing hatred, which is absolutely unjustified. Instead of social discourse, hatred spewed from both sides of the argument. Nothing is solved through such hatred, and no one will ever be won to your side if you spew hatred at them. It certainly seems that both sides are equally guilty of hatred.There is a way to fight the good fight without hatred. Dr. Martin Luther King proved that and will be forever remembered for his contributions.As Dr. King once said, “Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.”Chauhan also shared her viewpoints on the public encounter with Sean Spicer in a post on Medium.“Will they come after my family?” she queries. “Will they prevent me from traveling like they did with Khirzr Khan? Will they make sure that I am constantly under surveillance by the NSA?”She quoted Dr. Martin Luther King as he called for injustice to be exposed. She also calls people to action, offering several very important and constructive ways to make a difference, such as joining an advocacy group, calling your elected officials and the Congressional Switchboard phoneline.The right to assemble in protest of what the government does is also an important way to exercise your rights and be heard.
