2017 is set to be a landmark year for the smartphone niche, with these 10 exciting mobiles all on the horizon.It seems reasonable to assert that the highlight of the smartphone year will be the iPhone 8, with Apple likely to release three models this time round. This could be a particularly outstanding iPhone generation, with Apple expected to release something revolutionary in order to acknowledge the tenth generation of the iPhone series. Expect a physical redesign of the iconic device, and for Apple to embrace OLED and curved screen and technology, all suggesting that this will be the most impressive iPhone in spec terms for some years.Samsung will be keen to ensure that 2017 is considerably more successful than last year, following the travails associated with the Galaxy Note 7. First out of the traps from the Korean corporation will be the Galaxy S8. This flagship of the Samsung range will deliver some of the most impressive features and figures included in any smartphone. Some of the rumors related to the processor in this smartphone are pretty staggering, and if Samsung delivers on what many have anticipated then this will be an extremely exciting phone.However, probably the most anticipated device of 2017 from the Samsung stable will be the Galaxy Note 8. Again, Samsung must invest considerable resources in this device, as it must attract consumers back to the brand after the exploding Galaxy Note 7 alienated so many. Samsung believes it has solved the battery problems that caused the explosions, and will also ramp up the specs of this smartphone to impressive levels. This is likely to be the first ever 4K mobile from the Korean consumer electronics giant, and that alone is it surely worth waiting for.Google has yet to confirm the release of its second generation Pixel device, but the appearance of the smartphone is almost a certainty. The search engine behemoth has yet to make a massive impact in the consumer electronics niche, but this device could be the one to achieve this. Snapdragon 835 CPU, 4GB RAM, 5 and 5.7-inch screens both in quad HD resolution, Quick Charge 4.0, Android 8 and a water-resistant body are expected for the Pixel 2; a pretty nifty set of specs that could see it establish itself as a mainstream contender.The Chinese electronics company Xiaomi Is hardly a household name in the Western world, but it will help to change this perception with the release of the Xiaomi Mi6. Three separate models of this nifty mobile will be released, and the early spec rumors look rather promising. It will be powered by the MediaTek Helio X30 chipset, ensuring an affordable price tag, with ten CPU cores included. The Xiaomi Mi6 Standard has a Quad-HD resolution OLED display and is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, paired with 4GB of RAM and 128GB storage. A dual-camera tops off a more than decent performer that could make a splash this year.The LG G range has long since been acknowledged to be among the finest smartphone series in the world, and many will be looking forward to this release more than any other this year. The rumors point to a monster 6GB of RAM being included in this powerful performer, while a 5.7-inch display will slightly exceed quad HD resolution, sneaking into UHD territory. The 16-megapixel camera included in the LG G6 will be among the very best in the smartphone niche, and this device will likely be a standout for the Korean company once more.HTC is trying to build the consumer reputation that its devices have received critically for some years, and its latest attempt will be the HTC 11. Expected in the first quarter of 2017, this next generation smartphone will include some powerful specs. A 5.5-inch screen with quad HD display resolution, a nifty Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and Quick Charge 4.0 are all expected. But some of the other specs really catch the eye. The 12-megapixel dual primary camera is set to impress, as will the 8-megapixel selfie camera, but the 3,700mAh battery and 8GB of RAM will be amazing if delivered. This could be the most powerful and fastest smartphone of 2017.OnePlus is a real innovator in the smartphone niche, and consumers can expect something original once more when the OnePlus 4 hits the stores. OnePlus could follow the lead of HTC and include 8GB of RAM in the OnePlus 4, while rumors have suggested that OnePlus might introduce a curved screen, waterproofing and a dual camera. The emphasis, as always, will be on flexibility and smart design, and this will be another intriguing and left-field release in all probability.Nokia is a legendary name in mobile, but as the word ‘legendary’ would suggest, its great days are very firmly in the past. Nonetheless, the Nokia Sndroid phone will attempt to resurrect the fortunes of this once significant corporation. It is believed that this device has already been spotted in benchmarking, so the leaked specs of a 1.4GHz Snapdragon 430 processor, Adreno 505 graphics, 2GB of RAM, 16GB of storage and cameras rated at 13MP and 8MP can be considered pretty decent. An interesting bargain basement competitor worth looking out for.Sony has ruled the console marketplace over the last few years, but the same certainly cannot be said of the mobile niche. Nonetheless, its latest attempts to make a serious impression will arrive in the form of the latest Sony Xperia flagship. This device range has delivered some pretty impressive specs in the past, even if it failed to carve out a significant niche. Sony may particularly focus on the virtual reality capabilities of the smartphone, considering the early successes of its PlayStation VR headsets.
