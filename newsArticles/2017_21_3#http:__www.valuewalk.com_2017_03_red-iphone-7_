With barely any fanfare Apple has today announced the launch of a red iPhone 7 and a red 7 Plus. In a move which see’s the tech giant provide further help to the AIDS charity [PRODUCT] RED. Having worked with the charity previously, Apple is showing its commitment to the cause, while also making a bold statement of its own.Apple’s partnership with RED involves creating products with red themes and supporting its fundraising campaign. However, for Apple, this is a bold step. Previously, the latest color to make its way to the iPhone was Jet Black. However, it had been rumored for many years.As for the new Red iPhone 7, this color has featured in rumors, but an actual device bearing the color was deemed unlikely. Instead, many had considered a Jet White iPhone 7 to be on the way, now that will probably not happen. Regarding this new color, in the past, Apple has released red cases for its devices. But until now, never dared to release a handset bearing such a widely different coating.Now if you think this is the first red Apple device, you’re mistaken. For that, you have to go back to the iPod. Since then Apple has worked with RED for 10-years, supporting its HIV/AIDS programs. These efforts have helped to provide testing, medicine, and counseling aimed at preventing the transmission and further proliferation of HIV. During that period, Apple has helped to raise more than $130-million via the sale of RED products. As such the Red iPhone 7 is a continuation of its work to free the world of the scourge that is HIV/AIDS.If you missed the news late yesterday or earlier today Apple’s online store was down for maintenance across the world. With no reason suggested as to why, however, there were those who knew, new products were coming. As such this less than enthusiastic launch (no press event) has not come as much of a surprise for those who keep themselves informed.Now, if you’re wondering, when will the handsets be available to buy, Apple has stated that will be March 24th. Ordering will open at 08.01 am PDT/11:01 am ET. As for whether there is a pre-order process, having taken a look at the Store, there doesn’t seem to be. Instead, each handset will be available to buy on the day, obviously depending on stock levels.In a Press statement today Apple CEO, Tim Cook said:“The introduction of this special edition iPhone in a gorgeous red finish is our biggest (PRODUCT)RED offering to date in celebration of our partnership with (RED), and we can’t wait to get it into customers’ hands.”Looking gorgeous in Red, there are two storage capacities available for both the 7 and 7 Plus. They are 128GB and 256GB, with prices starting at $749.00 for the former and $869.00 for the latter. Along with these new iPhone iterations, Apple has also today launched a new 9.7-inch iPad, it’s cheapest to date.Image/Screenshot Source: Apple.com
