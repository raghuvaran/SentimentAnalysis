It’s been weeks since the release of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. Though the new iPhones didn’t suffer from major issues like bendgate, early buyers have been complaining about a variety of issues. For instance, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus owners on Verizon are facing LTE connectivity problems. They have taken to Reddit, Twitter, and Apple’s discussion boards to report the problem.According to multiple user complaints, the iPhone 7 units on Verizon randomly drop the LTE signal and fall back to 3G. They found that toggling the Airplane Mode on and off brings them back to LTE. Many others said they could reconnect to LTE only after restarting the phone. A few other users have also complained that their phones were repeatedly losing GPS signal.Neither Verizon nor Apple has officially commented on the problem. Fortunately, folks at Gizmodo claim to have identified the issue. Gizmodo said the problem was related to Voice over LTE functionality. It means you can eliminate the bug by turning off VoLTE from Settings > Cellular > Cellular Data Options > Enable LTE > Data Only. However, doing so will prevent you from using data during a call.According to a user comment on MacRumors message board, both Apple and Verizon are aware of the issue. Apple is reportedly working on a fix. Hopefully, an upcoming iOS 10 update will fix the LTE connectivity issue. Late last month, Verizon had replaced the SIM cards in the iPhones of some users who reported the issue. But the problem persisted even with the new SIM, indicating that it could be due to the iPhone’s software.Previously, AT&T users had complained that they lost connection after turning Airplane Mode off. Apple had recommended them to re-insert the SIM for data connection to work. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus users were also facing difficulty connecting their phones to the infotainment system of their cars via Bluetooth. Most of the affected users were BMW owners.Even when BMW owners were able to connect their iPhones to their cars, the Bluetooth audio playback would frequently cut out. The German automaker said last week that the iPhone 7 was not yet approved for its vehicles as it was still testing the device. However, BMW said an impending iOS update should fix the issue. Since Apple has removed the headphone jack from the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, users have to rely on Bluetooth or the Lightning port to listen to the music.
