Apple has launched new international versions of its smart keyboard accessory for the iPad Pro, which was previously available only in a U.S. English layout. The new version, which is available for the 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models, offers the smart keyboard accessory with localized layouts including British English, Italian, Arabic, Korean, Spanish and other language layouts. Differences similar to those on Apple’s Wireless keyboards for Macs are included in the new localized layouts. The new Arabic keyboard brings full support for the right-to-left language to the iPad Pro. Earlier this year, the Cupertino-based company debuted a new Arabic version of Apple.com with right-to-left reading support, and before that, it introduced all-inclusive right-to-left dialect support for iOS (with iOS 9).Apple’s new Smart Keyboard variants, which were launched through its regional websites, collectively comprise the first update to the iPad Pro accessory since its debut last year. Until now, consumers looking to purchase a first-party keyboard didn’t have any choice apart from the standard U.S. English layout.Apple’s international models are constructed from premium materials like a delicate feel polyurethane outer layer and microfiber interior similar to the original model. The accessory is believed to use the same dome key switches found on the U.S. version, covered by a protective canopy of spill-proof woven nylon, but this is not confirmed.The new keyboard layouts can already be bought on Apple’s website in countries where it is available.In September 2015, the iPhone maker first unveiled a Smart Keyboard alongside the 12.9-inch iPad Pro. The keyboard, which is the first accessory to support Apple’s Smart Connector port, does not require an internal power supply to operate or a Bluetooth radio. Hence, it is ideal for on-the-go use.Earlier this year, the Silicon Valley giant released the smaller 9.7-inch iPad Pro model with a detachable Smart Keyboard accessory following the launch of the first 12.9-inch iPad Pro in September.During the third quarter earnings call CEO Tim Cook, credited the iPad Pro for the “best iPad growth” in ten quarters, which included revenue growth of 7% despite the drop in overall unit sales.
