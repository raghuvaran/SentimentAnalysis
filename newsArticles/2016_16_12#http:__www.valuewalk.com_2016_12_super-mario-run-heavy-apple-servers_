Apple’s App Store servers got crushed under download pressure caused by the long-awaited game Super Mario Run. A number of users were unable to conduct searches or view certain apps, including the new Mario game on Thursday morning, notes AppleInsider.The App Store service outages and general feature unavailability left many users agitated. They took to social media to report the problems they are facing. What was more frustrating was that Apple’s system status webpage was showing green across the board.AppleInsider also conducted some impromptu tests and found that the iOS App Store was not working as designed on devices located on both coasts. This suggested that the problem was nationwide.When attempts were made to use the app’s search function, users are redirected to a landing page that reads, “The App Store is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later.”Another related issue that users were facing was that whenever they browsed through the app categories, it triggered the generic WebKit error. When other App Store areas on an iOS device are browsed, other error messages like “Try again” pop up, notes AppleInsider.All the issues, it seems, were related to the launch of Nintendo’s much-anticipated Super Mario Run. Also all six of Apple’s promotional carousel spots atop the App Store’s Featured section lead to an error page of one kind or another.Later on Thursday, Apple updated its system status webpage to reflect an outage that affected all its online stores, including Apple Music, Apple TV, the iOS App Store and the Mac App Store. It was after 4 p.m. Pacific that the problems began. It continued for more than three hours until 7 p.m. Pacific, after which all the services were back up and running, notes AppleInsider.Nintendo announced the game Super Mario Run during Apple’s iPhone 7 event in September. This is the company’s first attempt at developing a third-party mobile platforming title based on one of its legendary franchises. Due to the hype generated by the game, Apple even set up a special notification system to alert users when downloads go live.Within 12 hours of the launch of the game on Thursday, it was atop two of Apple’s Top Charts: top grossing and the most popular free app. Though the game is free to download, paying $9.99 will give full access to all six game worlds, 3,000 coins and 20 Toad Rally tickets.
