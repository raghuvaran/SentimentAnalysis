Knock-off charging cables for the Apple Watch are now available on Amazon for a higher price than the authentic version. The cables come from lesser-known brands including WL, Reiko, and Somodor.  The accessories will retail for $45 to $58. Apple’s own 1-meter Watch charging cable starts at $29.99.Fake and knock-off Apple accessories are nothing new, but knock-offs that cost more than the actual Apple versions are rather interesting. Amazon does not sell official Apple Watch cables, so sellers think it’s something they can get away with.One of the fake charging cables is Reiko’s Data Cable for the Apple Watch. The magnetic cable is used specifically for charging, not data. Some of the photos show all-plastic cables shipped with the Apple Watch Sport. The listings claim the cables are high temperature resistant complete with good air permashock absorption.In other Apple Watch-related news, one of the watch’s best features is coming to the iPhone. Apple is supposedly bringing the Force Touch feature to future iPhones. Sources claim Apple suppliers already started early production of future iPhone models with the improved touch screen technology. The addition is speculated to help give the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus a boost over rivals like Samsung.Overall sales of iPhone units climbed 40% this March quarter to reach to 61.2 million, a number that trumped estimates of 58.1 million. The iPhone 6 was able to help Apple end rival Samsung’s three-year reign as top-selling smartphone. Overall iPhone sales in China also outpaced sales in the United States. 2015 is shaping up to be quite a year for Apple.Innovation is the key to Apple’s success. It’s a smart move to take one product’s best feature and adapt it to another product. Apple knows that it is vital to innovate products, and so far the company’s innovations have yet to steer it wrong.
