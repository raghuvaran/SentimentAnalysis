Apple just acquired FoundationDB, a software program that can perform ACID-compliant transactions at super fast speeds. Apple reportedly purchased the company with bolstering cloud services in mind.The report, which first came from TechCrunch, speculates that the technology could become a part of iTunes, the App Store or iTunes in the Cloud. There is also the remote chance it could be integrated into Apple’s rumored TV service. Previous reports point toward Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reaching a content service deal for iOS, Mac and Apple TV customers.Neither Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) nor FoundationDB confirmed the purchase; however, the latter announced on its official website that it was no longer allowing downloads for its database software. Apple claimed it buys up smaller companies frequently and usually doesn’t share initial plans. FoundationDB was formed in 2009 by David Rosenthal, Nick Lavezzo and David Scherer. Rosenthal was the company’s chief executive officer and previously held the VP of engineering position at Omniture.FoundationDB became a desirable acquisition target when it handled ACID-compliant transactions with strong scalability. In 2012, the company had a booth at TechCrunch’s Disrupt SF conference. It was apparent that the company offered a modern approach to the NoSQL database. Just last year, the company unveiled a faster engine with up to 14.4 million random writes per second.Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s latest acquisition could be a huge win for the company. A fast and durable database could be just what the iPhone maker needs to boost server technologies. The App Store offers millions of apps, and many of those apps are being served to users. There is also plenty of room for system improvements.The reliability and speed of Apple’s cloud services are important. The vast majority of Apple users rely on their iPhones and iPads to access cloud-based services. The mobile industry will continue to grow, and so will the cloud industry. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) needs to update its technologies to accommodate growth and meet the ever-changing needs of consumers.
