Supply chain leaks, rumors and analyst reports have already dubbed the upcoming iPhone 7 as a “minor upgrade” that will look similar to the iPhone 6S. But the device will have more than just a few changes. The upcoming iPhone 7 is expected to get rid of the 3.5mm headphone jack, feature a relocated antenna bands, and offer better water & dust-resistance.A new report coming out of Asia indicates that the next-gen iPhone will have a slightly larger earpiece above the screen. Citing supply chain sources, Japanese website MacOtakara reports that the device will also relocate the ambient light sensor. These changes will require manufacturers and vendors of protective LCD films to come up with new film designs.According to MacOtakara, manufacturers of protective films have stopped received orders as the new iPhone will introduce some front panel changes. The ambient light sensor will be relocated from the left side to the right side of the earpiece. The proximity sensor will also get an update with “dual specification.” It means the proximity sensor will be split into two: the omitter and receiver sensors.The proximity sensor measures how far the device is held to your head during a phone call. The Japanese publication reiterated that the Plus version of the iPhone will sport a dual-lens rear camera while the standard 4.7-inch model will have a larger camera. All these changes appear minor considering the overall design of the phone is said to be similar to the iPhone 6 and 6S.Removal of the headphone jack could help Apple reduce the thickness of the iPhone 7 by as much as 1mm, according to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. Earlier this week, the Wall Street Journal reported that the most important features will be kept for the 2017 iPhone 8, which is expected to feature an all-glass design. Apple will be celebrating the 10th anniversary of the iPhone next year.
