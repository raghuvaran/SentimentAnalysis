Wherever you are and whatever smartphone brand you follow 2017 will be a year of massive changes. One that will see (if rumors are accurate) many handset manufacturers adopt OLED Display technology for their flagship handsets. As for which will come out on top, it’s likely to be one of the usual culprits. However, this year that may not just be Samsung or Google. As Apple is rumored to be entering the fray, so let’s take a look at the possibilities.Could 2017 be the year that Apple finally catches up with its rivals in the display technology department? Rumors are circling which suggest it is, and it’s hard to believe it will stick with LCD again. Especially when you consider all the hype around the iPhones 10th anniversary.As for what the rumors are saying, apparently Apple will not only include an OLED display, but it will also be flexible. And be curved with almost no bezel, you may be familiar with the no Home Button rumors. It backs up the edge-to-edge-screen rumor, but an OLED display would be something completely different for Apple.If you’re not aware, there are two widely used OLED panels which differ by their color gamut technologies. Many of 2016s devices used Adobe RGB gamut, while others used the more advanced DCI-P3 gamut. Of the two Apple is expected to use the latter due to its ability to provide a wider color gamut and greater brightness. Which will inevitably lead to the iPhone 8 having a much-increased pixel per inch ratio that its predecessors. As well as a resolution which could be somewhere between 2160 x 1080 and 2880 x 1440 pixels.According to those who may know the Galaxy S8 could be launched as early March 29th. And like its predecessors, it will also have an OLED display. However, what may be different this year is the type of OLED Samsung chooses as those found on the S7 and S7 Edge. And that’s because the older models used the Adobe RGB gamut technology, whereas it’s being rumored the S8 will use DCI-P3 tech.As for the validity of this rumor, no one knows but is more likely that the Galaxy S8 will have it. Why? Because Samsung is currently the market leader for smartphone-sized OLED’s and it provides the world with around 95% of what is available. Another reason why this rumor may, in fact, be accurate is that the Galaxy Note 7 featured the same technology. So there’s no reason why the South Korean giant couldn’t just use it again!Moving onto the design, a long-standing rumor points towards the S8 and S8 Plus both having curved displays. And further, suggests that Samsung could be about to do away with the more traditional flat panel on its flagships. Again, if accurate, this would force it to change screen share and resolution. Meaning that a resolution between 2800 x 1440 and 3840 x 1920 pixels, and an aspect ratio of 2.0 may be possible.If all of the Galaxy Note 8 rumors are true, it looks as though Samsung could be about to produce a handset with VR as its focus. Why? While the ill-fated Note 7 featured an OLED display, most rumors suggest that will not be the case this time. Instead, an AMOLED super high-density display has been touted, is this true? I don’t know, or believe it, as Samsung is currently the King of OLED and it makes no sense for it not to use it!As for those 4K rumors floating around, that is where VR comes in. As the difference it brings would be hardly noticeable to the naked eye. In fact, the Human eye has trouble noticing any difference in quality above Full-HD. So, 4K must be for when you have the Note 8 strapped to your face using Google’s Daydream view, or Samsung’s own Gear VR headsets.Google must have known it was onto something when it along with HTC created the Pixel and Pixel XL handsets. The release of those handsets catapulted it to a place it could have only dreamed that previous handsets could reach. And as such, 2017 will see a Google Pixel 2, which like the others featured here will have an OLED display. Well, that is if you believe the rumors it will!Additionally, the talk suggests this year’s model will get an OLED upgrade. Which see’s Google change from using an Adobe RGB gamut to the more advanced DCI-P3 gamut as seen on all the devices above. As with the Note 8, this could be due to virtual reality, and the fact that improved brightness of 1000 nits is possible. As well as the fact that an increase in performance is seen in ambient light, and with HDR content.So there you have them four handsets which could all benefit from using OLED display technology in 2017. Is any of this true? To be honest there’s no knowing for sure at this point! However, as soon as one of my colleagues or I hear anything concrete it will be published!
