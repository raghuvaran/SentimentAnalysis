Ahead of the Oct.27 event, Russian trademark filings reveal that the Cupertino company is planning to release three new Macs running the latest macOS Sierra. The three products have model numbers A1706, A1707, and A1708, and all three of them are “portable personal computer models.”Previous rumors suggest that the tech giant will launch upgraded versions of 13.3-inch and 15.4-inch MacBook Pro. The third device is said to be an ultrathin 13-inch sibling to the 12-inch MacBook. Apple is rumored to discontinue the 11-inch MacBook Air. It is still unclear what would happen to the 13-inch MacBook Air.The new MacBook Pro is expected to get improved internal components, USB-C ports, Thunderbolt 3, Touch ID fingerprint sensor, and a slimmer design. But its biggest feature would be an OLED display panel that will replace the function keys. The OLED touch bar will perform the same tasks as physical function keys, but it will also allow keys to be dynamic to match the applications.
