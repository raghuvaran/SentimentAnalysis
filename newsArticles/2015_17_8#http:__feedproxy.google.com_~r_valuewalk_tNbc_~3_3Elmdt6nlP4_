Google wants fans to guess the name of the next version of its mobile operating system, currently code-named “Android M.” The search giant usually names operating systems after popular desserts like Froyo, Gingerbread, Ice Cream Sandwich and Kit Kat. The company is now teasing fans with a video of suggested name possibilities, including Moon Pie, Marshmallow, Macadamia Brittle, Muffin and others. The video gives many suggestions but reminds us that only one can be right.At the end of the video, there is a clip of a person working on a statue of the Android robot in white, suggesting the new system could be named Marshmallow. The video was created by Google employees Nat and Lo as a clever marketing trick to get people excited about the next version of the operating system.Previous rumors indicated Google would name the next version of the OS “Milkshake.” The rumor was started when the Android VP of engineering David Burke was seen wearing his smartwatch with the face displaying an image of a milkshake. Later on, Burke stated that he set up his watch to show cycles of his favorite M desserts. He even shared an image with four watch faces featuring his favorite M desserts.Google unveiled Android M earlier this summer during its annual I/O event. The new mobile operating system boasts updated app permissions, including Google Now on Tap, and a Chrome feature to enhance the web experience. Android M also comes with the Android Mobile payment system to make it more competitive against rival Apple’s iOS 9 and Apple Pay. The new Android mobile system also comes with fingerprint APIs, a battery saver called Doze and an upgraded RAM manager.Fans will have to wait until the end of the year for Google to reveal its new operating system.
