Apple is retiring its much-loved monitor, the Thunderbolt Display. The last inventory of it is still available in the Apple store for a not-so-cheap price of $999, and once it is is sold out, the tech giant will not be selling its only monitor anymore.For the Cupertino-based firm, this is probably the end of producing standalone displays for computers. The monitor was introduced in 2011 but never updated. Since 2011, users have been hoping that they would have a replacement. The display offers resolution of 2560×1440, while the iMac, which includes an actual computer inside, comes in at $800 more.“We’re discontinuing the Apple Thunderbolt Display. It will be available through Apple.com, Apple’s retail stores and Apple Authorized Resellers while supplies last. There are a number of great third-party options available for Mac users,” said an Apple spokesperson.However, those third-party options will not be sold at the Apple store. You are on your own to find the best one if you need a display for your Mac.Apple’s decision leaves it without a branded monitor to offer Mac users. It is still not clear whether the Silicon Valley giant intends to replace the monitor with something in the future or not.For some time now, users have been hoping the iPhone maker would launch a display with 5K resolution to match the current high-end iMac, but there have been no hints from the company. Some rumors did suggest that the tech giant was preparing a Thunderbolt Display with a 5K Retina display and its own graphics card, but this new report pours cold water on such claims.Also, speaking of the MacRumors Buyer’s Guide, one cannot help but note that a lot of Macs are starting to look a little long in the tooth. So there are chances of updates in the near future, says The Verge. In addition, a major refresh of the MacBook Pro is rumored, but whether this refresh is going to be coupled with a new monitor made by Apple is not certain yet.On Thursday, Apple shares closed up 0.58% at $96.10. Year to date, the stock is down by over 10%, while in the last year, it is down by over 24%. The stock has a 52-week high of $132.97 and a 52-week low of $89.47.
