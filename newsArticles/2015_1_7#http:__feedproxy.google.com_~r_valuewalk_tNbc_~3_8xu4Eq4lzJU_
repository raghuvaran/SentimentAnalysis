Apple has updated its warranty program to make it simpler to replace the batteries of its devices at any of its stores. The new AppleCare+ policy allows users to swap batteries in their iOS devices even when the capacity drops below 80% of the original life.AppleCare+’s new policy reads: “The capacity of the Covered Equipment’s battery to hold an electrical charge is less than eighty percent (80%) of its original specifications.” Now it appears that any device with a battery capacity that has fallen below the previous threshold is eligible for a new battery.Apple’s updated policy is a relief for users who have long struggled with a lack of improvements in battery technology. Prior to this update, the iPhone maker did change the batteries on iOS devices after they fell below 50% of the capacity. However, obsolete batteries could not be exchanged unless there was a manufacturing defect.The change comes as a boon for users as batteries in Apple products are not user-replaceable, which implies that if something goes wrong, the warranty ends once the customer open the case and tries to swap the battery. This usually happens after batteries start draining, and customers used to replace the batteries.The AppleCare+ protection covers batteries across devices ranging from the iPhone, iPad, iPod, Apple Watch, MacBook, MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. As per the California-based company, the update will apply to new purchases and retroactively to any device still under warranty. However, the company has said it will entertain only valid claims.The AppleCare+ warranty for the Watch Sport costs $49. For the iPod Touch, it costs $59, and it’s $69 for the standard Watch, $99 for iPhones or iPads, and between $250 and $350 for MacBooks.In a separate development, Apple Music debuted on Tuesday with sturdy support from music artists with one of the artists saying that he never expected his music to be a part of something so big. The Indie UK band Spring King had a surprising moment when its name was chosen as the first to be played by DJ Zane Lowe on Apple Music’s new live Beats 1 radio station.Taylor Swift’s letter was significant to the decision made by Apple to pay artists during the three-month free trial period. Swift scolded Apple’s Initial policy of not giving musicians their royalties during the period.
