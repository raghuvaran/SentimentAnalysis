The Apple Watch, the wrist wear from the iPhone company, is now being delivered to customers, and thus we are getting the initial reviews on the gadget. Like every other Apple product, users are reporting a flaw with this one as well. A new thread on Reddit claims people with tattoos on their wrists are not able to enjoy the device they have spent heavily on.Tattoo-gate, a serious issue for Apple? The reason cited for the malfunctioning of the device is that the watch emits infrared light, which gets reflected by the tattoo in such a manner that it causes confusion with the wrist detection feature.So it is claimed that people wearing long sleeves and tattoos on the wrist are facing the problem of not being able to use the Apple Watch properly. Such users receive no notifications, and to get those notifications, they should either wear the watch over the un-tattooed part of their arm or turn off the wrist detection feature.Wearing the Apple Watch on an area other than the wrist is a weird solution and a complete no for people who wear clothing that covers their arms completely. Also turning off the wrist detection feature will stop Apple Pay from working. So it seems like a serious issue for Apple and for users (of course if all this is true).Soon after using the device, user comments began to pour in, discussing the problems they are facing with the device. One user narrates the experience with the Apple Watch in detail, saying, “I thought my shiny new 42mm [Watch] had a bad wrist detector sensor.”The user wrote that the watch prompted for a password to unlock it each time the screen went dark. Notifications were also not received. The Apple Watch was consistently in contact with the wearer’s skin, so it was difficult to figure out exactly what was going wrong.When the user was not able to find anything related with the issue online, he tried putting it on his hand, which was neither sleeved nor tattooed, unlike his left arm. The watch started working and remained unlocked as well, and no malfunctioning took place. Then to confirm, the user again placed it back on the tattooed area, and as was expected, the malfunctioning started again.“Once I put it back on the area that is tattooed with black ink the watch would automatically lock again.”
