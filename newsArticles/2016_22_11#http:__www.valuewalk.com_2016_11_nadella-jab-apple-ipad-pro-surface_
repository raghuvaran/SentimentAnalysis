Apple CEO Tim Cook will now realize that words can come back to haunt him. Microsoft Chief Satya Nadella has taken some of Cook’s words and lightly wafted them right back at him, according to CNET. Nadella mused on the growing success of the Surface tablet in an interview with the Australian Financial Review.Nadella painted it as example of Microsoft’s risk-taking ability. Also the CEO contrasted this attitude with that of his rivals. He said that the two-in-one idea was questioned as a form factor three years ago.“And now guess what, even our competition has decided that it’s not a refrigerator and a toaster, but it’s actually a two-in-one.”Nadella was a little wrong, as it was not three years ago, but four years ago, says CNET. On a 2012 earnings call, Cook contemplated hybrid computers, saying that converging two divergent products had too many trade-offs.“You can converge a toaster and a refrigerator, but those things are probably not going be pleasing to the user,” the Apple CEO said.In the August release of the iPad Pro, the Cupertino-based firm claimed that it was a computer. This confused a lot of customers, as the tech giant always insisted that the iPad Pro was a tablet. Microsoft had something to laugh about at the time.Nadella told the Financial Review that one has to make space for failures. Everything will not work, and one has to take the jokes for a while until they are suddenly imitated.In other Apple news, citing people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg reports that Apple is moving engineers off the development of wireless routers.
