Apple and Google phones seized from any criminal are hard to crack, according to Manhattan DA Cyrus Vance Jr, who appealed to law enforcement authorities to come up with regulations restricting these companies from creating software that makes them difficult to crack. While making things hard for law enforcement may be considered good by consumers and businesses, on the darker side, terrorists are able to misuse it in their benefit.While carrying out any sort of criminal investigation, it becomes an utmost necessity for authorities involved to decrypt devices. Therefore, Manhattan DA Cyrus Vance Jr., approached law enforcement agencies for support in a quest against Apple and Google, says a report from the New York Post.Speaking on the “Cats Roundtable” show on WNYM/970 AM, Vance said, “Apple has created a phone that is dark that cannot be accessed by law enforcement even when a court has authorized us to look at its contents.” He further said that with such arrangements, terrorists are going to prefer these phones. On Sunday, DA Cyrus Vance Jr. informed listeners that it is the need of the hour to roll back software that helps terrorists with their illegal activities, and therefore, some kind of pressure needs to be created on elected officials by the police.While general consumers might be very delighted with the features offered by the latest version of the OS from Apple, i.e., iOS 8, the ones concerned with the safety and security of the nation are not praising the recent updates.U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton were among the several other top law enforcement officials who don’t like iOS 8. He said it was shameful that they were consciously doing so to gain profits, knowing it would pose a serious threat to efforts made by law enforcement teams to ensure national safety and security.Apple and Google defended themselves, saying that they design products and services keeping customers’ needs on priority. Android phones will soon be introduced with a new software update from Google that will make it impossible for police and prosecutors to trace the device. Google and Apple together account for around 96% of the total cell phone market.
