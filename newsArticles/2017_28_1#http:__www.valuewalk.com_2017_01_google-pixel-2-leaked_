Google released its high-end Pixel and Pixel XL only a few months ago. Both devices have garnered praise from consumers and critics alike. Now details about the next-generation Google Pixel 2 have started surfacing on the Internet. A source who has been reliable in the past told 9to5Google that Pixel 2 would see major upgrades in terms of processor, camera, waterproofing, and price.Pixel is one of the best Android smartphones available today. An improved Pixel 2 could establish Google’s reputation as a world-class premium smartphone vendor. The source had previously told 9to5Google that the new smartphone will “definitely” have waterproof capabilities. They said yesterday that the feature was “still on the table.” The original Pixel was expected to be waterproof, but the feature is now rumored to debut with Pixel 2.Little tidbit we were told in October last year that I forgot about: “Waterproofing definitely coming with next Pixel device.”— Stephen Hall (@hallstephenj) January 25, 2017The search engine giant is also working to improve the phone’s camera. There won’t be a huge jump in the megapixel count. Instead, Google would focus on the “extra features.” The camera has been one of the key selling points of the original Pixel. The company aims to further enhance low-light photography with the new device.The source told 9to5Google that Google has been testing Pixel 2 with improved processors from Qualcomm and Intel. Taiwanese company MediaTek was also involved at one point, but it is no longer collaborating with Google. The Mountain View-based company has also developed a “custom chip for a test device,” but it is too early to say whether the custom chipset will make it to the final version of Pixel 2.All these features and improvements are going to come at an additional cost. Many users have already complained that the original Pixel costs as much as the iPhone. The report claims that Google Pixel 2 is going to cost at least $50 more than its predecessor.Fortunately, some potential buyers need not worry about Pixel 2’s higher price tag. That’s because Google is also working on a cheaper Pixel 2B that will arrive “either alongside or shortly after” Google Pixel 2. The Pixel 2B model will have less powerful hardware and will be aimed at developing markets. A cheaper version will help the Pixel brand penetrate into emerging markets. The company’s goal is to “bring the Google experience and the Google phone to emerging markets.”The original Pixel is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor and 4GB RAM. It comes with a 12.3-megapixel main camera with f/2.0 aperture, and an 8-megapixel front snapper. Pixel is available in 32GB and 128GB  built-in storage options, but it does not have a microSD card slot.
