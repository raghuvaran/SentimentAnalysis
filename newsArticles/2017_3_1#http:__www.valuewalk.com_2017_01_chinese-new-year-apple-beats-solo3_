The guide features a range of red products such as an iPhone 7 case, a limited edition DJI Phantom 4 drone, a lion dance LionBot kit, an Apple Watch Sport Band and more. Last year, the U.S. firm introduced two exclusive Apple Watch Sport models with dark red stripes to celebrate the Chinese New Year.In order to woo Asian customers, the U.S. firm has initiated similar sales in the past as well. For instance, in 2014, the company announced a one-day “Red Friday” sales event, giving shoppers moderate discounts on select merchandise, notes AppleInsider.India is another major Asian market on Apple’s radar. Citing a senior government official, ET says the Indian government may allow it to set up a manufacturing unit if Apple agrees to make a huge investment in the country and promises to generate jobs in large numbers.
