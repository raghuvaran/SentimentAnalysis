Another iPhone has gone up in flames, and now Apple has launched an investigation. Samsung is already dealing with a large mess surrounding the Galaxy Note 7 as more and more reports of exploding phones pile up. Now Apple seems to be in the same mess (though still with only a few cases), and it is going to probe in-depth to find out the reason.Samsung’s widely-publicized predicament has drawn increased attention to smartphone fires from other vendors as well, as such things can happen to anyone, although not with the frequency we have seen in recent reports about the Note 7. In recent weeks, several iPhones have also exploded, including an iPhone 6 Plus, an iPhone 7, and an iPhone 7 Plus. Though the issue is not comparable to Samsung’s troubles, the U.S. firm has started investigating the matter after a second iPhone 6 Plus has caught fire, reports BGR.Yvette Estrada, who owns an iPhone, says that her iPhone 6 Plus spontaneously exploded in the middle of the night.Last week, Estrada told ABC30, “I heard a sizzling, then we heard the pop and the whole fire was coming out of the screen.”According to the report, the explosion began a small fire, and then Estrada’s husband acted promptly by throwing the phone into the sink. Estrada stated that they called 911 for assistance after putting water onto the device.Around 3 a.m., firefighters arrived to discover debris, a melted phone and ash. The iPhone owner told the TV station that the smartphone got so hot that it damaged a pair of glasses, two Apple Watch stands and the dresser. Estrada noted that the situation would have been much worse if it had been underneath her pillow or if she was on the phone.“Hopefully they can fix this, and they can compensate my new phone or do something for me because they have to do right,” Estrada said.Apple is looking into Estrada’s explosion and another case involving an iPhone 6 Plus that caught fire last week while in a student’s back pocket. The iPhone maker offered Estrada a free replacement of the iPhone 6 Plus, a new stand for the watch and a charger. An upgrade to the iPhone 7 was offered as well, but Estrada would have to pay for it, notes BGR.Unfortunately Estrada had not been backing up her data, so she will not be able to recover any of her pictures of her children or any of the smartphone’s other contents. Meanwhile after reports that the replacement devices issued are now exploding, Samsung has now suspended production of the Galaxy Note 7. The Korean firm has warned customers to “power down and stop using the device.”
