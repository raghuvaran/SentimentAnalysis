Apple CEO Tim Cook and several other top tech executives were at Trump Tower last week for a meeting with President-elect Donald Trump. It would have been pretty awkward for him to be there, as he always preferred Hillary Clinton over Trump and even held a fundraiser for her in August.TechCrunch obtained a post made on Apple’s intranet on Monday in which Cook explained the purpose of his meeting with Trump. He said the number of issues (like renewable energy, tax reform, and intellectual property reform) that need to be resolved is pretty large, and the way to advance them is to engage.“Personally, I’ve never found being on the sideline a successful place to be. The way that you influence these issues is to be in the arena. So whether it’s in this country, or the European Union, or in China or South America, we engage. And we engage when we agree and we engage when we disagree. I think it’s very important to do that because you don’t change things by just yelling,” Cook noted.Apple runs its business on 100% renewable energy, said Cook. This is the first time the company has claimed that. The company last claimed that nearly 93% of its operations around the world get power from renewable energy. Google announced earlier this month that it will run its business on 100% renewable energy as well, notes Business Insider.People have begun to feel that Apple has abandoned the desktop, but Cook is trying to dispel the feeling. In the internal message, Cook also claimed that desktops are “very strategic” for the company. In October, the company released an overhauled MacBook Pro laptop, but it hasn’t updated much of its Mac lineup of desktops for several years. Seeing this, Mac fans have begun to believe that Apple is forsaking the desktop.In the post, however, Cook made it clear that the company has some great desktops in its roadmap, and there are no reasons for anyone to worry.Stressing the importance of desktops, Cook said, “It’s unique compared to the notebook,” as in a desktop, one can put a lot more performance, for instance, a big screen, more storage, more memory, etc. “So there are many different reasons why desktops are really important, and in some cases critical, to people,” Cook noted.
