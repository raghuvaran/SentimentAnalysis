The iPhone 7 (or iPhone 6S or whatever you want to call it) rumors just keep on coming, with the same ones rearing their ugly heads time and time again. This time we have the rumors about sapphire glass and Apple bumping the RAM up to 2 gigabytes again.A report from a Korean news source said Corning is developing a new type of smartphone glass dubbed “Project Phire.” Apple already uses Corning’s ultra-hard Gorilla Glass in its current iPhone models, and the new “Phire” glass is said to be taking Gorilla Glass up another notch in hardness by adding sapphire glass to it.When Apple struck a deal with the now-bankrupt GTAT, it was speculated that the company was going to use sapphire glass in its products much more heavily, possibly in the iPhone 6. Of course that didn’t happen, so now we’re hearing the sapphire rumor again but from a different angle.While sapphire glass is known to be extremely resistant to scratches, one big problem with it is that it can break when hit on the side. If Corning can find a way to combine sapphire with its Gorilla Glass, it would be a big win for the company because Gorilla Glass tends to scratch easily. By combining the two types of glass, Corning could get the best of both worlds.A separate report from the Master Herald claims Apple will finally up the amount of RAM for the iPhone 7 to 2 gigabytes. The report cites an unnamed source for the information and echoes other reports we’ve heard from other sources. The current iPhone models still have only 1 gigabyte of RAM, compared to other flagship models by competitors that feature 2 gigabytes. If Apple finally does bump up the RAM, it would finally catch up to those competitors.Apple did bump up the iPad Air 2 to 2 gigabytes of RAM, making it the first Apple device to be increased from 1 gigabyte. It had been rumored that the iPhone 6 would have 2 gigabytes of RAM, but alas, that didn’t happen.The Master Herald also reports that the iPhone 7 will have an upgraded processor, which is pretty much a given as Apple upgrades the processor in its iPhones pretty much every year. The website’s sources reportedly said the A10 chip will be out in 2016.As of this writing, shares of Apple were down 0.52% to $126.93 per share.
