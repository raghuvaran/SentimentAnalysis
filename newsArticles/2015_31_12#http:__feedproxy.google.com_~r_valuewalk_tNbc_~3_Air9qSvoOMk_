While cleaning out my Google Drive, I came across an old spreadsheet I was tinkering with but never finished.Until now.It’s a very simple RSS stock news aggregator via google spreadsheets.If you don’t want to read the rest of this article, just click any of the button below to get your copy and get started right away.The idea with the spreadsheet was to reduce the number of clicks and pages you have to visit in order to check news headlines.At the moment, with a portfolio you have on finance sites like Google Finance, Yahoo Finance or Seeking Alpha, the headlines related to the stocks in your portfolio are all listed sequentially.The problem with this is that the headlines for unpopular stocks are constantly pushed down the list.If you have Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) or any of the popular stocks, the entire list is just filled with AAPL which I find utterly annoying.Does this look familiar?News for my small to mid cap stocks are no where to be found.Here’s how it looks on Yahoo Finance for these stocks.No micro caps in the list, but still…I’m surprised Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, Inc. (NASDAQ:RMCF) even made it on the list.The examples are exaggerated somewhat, but you get the point.So my idea was that it would be much easier to keep track of stocks if the news were actually organized on a per stock basis.Something like this.If you look at the ADDvantage Technologies Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:AEY) example, the latest news for AEY was on Nov 19 and then followed by Feb 3.That’s a huge gap.But at least this way, you get a much better idea of how things are going. Plus you are less likely to miss out on potentially important news. It also makes it easier to review what happened in the past too.No more scrolling to infinity to get past the galaxy of AAPL and TSLA news.To get the spreadsheet for yourself, click on any of the buttons below to unlock the link.A Google account is required for you to be able to use this.If you are reading this via email, you will need to come to the website to get your download link.If you do not have any social accounts to unlock this content, click the Google+ button to unlock the link.Copy the spreadsheet to your account by going to File > Make a Copy.Then enter any name and once you press OK, it will make a copy to your Google Drive account.Then in the main worksheet, follow the instructions on the page.
