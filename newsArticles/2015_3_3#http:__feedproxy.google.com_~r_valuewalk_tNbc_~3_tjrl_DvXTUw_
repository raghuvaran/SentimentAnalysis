The Apple Watch could be simultaneously released outside the United States, unlike the other devices from the iPhone maker which were only limited to the U.S. initially. Last week, Apple CEO Tim Cook, while speaking at an Apple store in Berlin, said, the new wearable will launch in Germany in April, according to a report from 9To5Mac.When Apple launched the iPhone, it was limited to the United States first for several months, while the iPad was launched exclusively in the U.S. in April 2010 and then was launched in Europe and Australia over a month later in mid-May of that year.In January, Cook said the Apple Watch would be sold in April without naming the countries that will be the part of the initial launch. However, Cook’s statement in Berlin does hint at a wider roll-out of new product categories from the company.Citing sources, the report says that apart from Germany, Australia will also receive the Apple Watch, as the company is apparently training a few Apple retail employees on sales procedures through secret briefings in Sydney. Other countries such as the United Kingdom and France are also gearing up for the Apple Watch’s arrival, says the report.Canada generally appears in the list of the countries that get Apple devices in the first phase, and the company is soon planning to launch the Watch-compatible Apple Pay system there. However, as of now, there is no confirmation on if the country will get the new product in April.The Cupertino, Calif.-based company is heavily promoting the Apple Watch in China, suggesting the wearable could launch in or around April in the Chinese market. Government regulations in China could delay the launch of Apple Watch in the first phase, says the report.Whatever the case may be, it is for sure that Apple fans outside the United States will not have to wait for very long before for the wearable. The company is expected to provide more details on its upcoming gadget at an event scheduled for March 9.
