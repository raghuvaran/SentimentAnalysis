Three of the big phablet contenders already available are the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, Apple iPhone 7 Plus and Google Pixel XL. As the new year sales approach, many consumers will be considering purchasing one of these three mobiles. So how do the handsets compare with one another in key areas?The Galaxy S7 Edge is marginally the slinkiest of the three handsets. Measuring 150.9 x 72.6 x 7.7 mm (5.94 x 2.86 x 0.30 in), the Galaxy S7 Edge is smaller than either the iPhone 7 Plus or Pixel XL. The iPhone 7 Plus measures 158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3 mm (6.23 x 3.07 x 0.29 in), while the Pixel XL’s dimensions are 154.7 x 75.7 x 8.5 mm (6.09 x 2.98 x 0.33 in).Advantage: Galaxy S7 EdgeAgain, The Galaxy S7 Edge has a minor advantage over the two other mobiles in this department. Indeed, the 157g weight of the Galaxy S7 Edge is around 20 percent lighter than the 188g of the iPhone 7 Plus. Separating the two is the Google Pixel XL, which has a weight just 11g more than the Galaxy S7 Edge at 168g.Advantage: Galaxy S7 EdgeThere is absolutely nothing to choose between the three smartphones in this department, with each benefiting from a 5.5-inch display.Advantage: TieBoth the Galaxy S7 Edge and and Pixel XL feature superior resolution over the iPhone 7 Plus. The Apple phablet is a full HD mobile, meaning that it is capable of displaying 1,080 x 1,920 pixels (~401 ppi pixel density). Both The Galaxy S7 Edge and Pixel XL are full HD smartphones, meaning that they are able to display 1440 x 2560 pixels (~534 ppi pixel density).Advantage: Galaxy S7 Edge and Pixel XLEach of the three contenders delivers a significantly different package with regard to processors, with arguably the Galaxy S7 Edge being the superior of the three. The Galaxy S7 Edge is built on what is described as octa-core technology, although in reality it really benefits from two bundles of quad-core processors. Quad-core 2.3 GHz Mongoose and 1.6 GHz Cortex-A53 processors are included in the Galaxy S7 Edge.Meanwhile, both the Apple iPhone 7 Plus and Google Pixel XL deliver quad-core processors, although the latter is more accurately based on two bundles of dual-core processors. The iPhone 7 Plus features a quad-core 2.23 GHz, while the Pixel XL has 2×2.15 GHz Kryo & 2×1.6 GHz Kryo included within its makeup.Apple has always relied on its unique combination of proprietary hardware and software in order to ensure that the iPhone series performs particularly capably, but nonetheless the Galaxy S7 Edge has a slight advantage over the Apple device in pure spec terms.Advantage: Galaxy S7 EdgeBoth the Galaxy S7 Edge and Pixel XL feature 4GB of RAM memory, which is 1GB more than the 3GB included in the Apple iPhone 7 Plus. Again, the software collaboration in the Apple device has often compensated for such lower specs, but nonetheless the two Android-driven mobiles have the advantage here.Advantage: Galaxy S7 Edge and Pixel XLThe iPhone 7 Plus benefits from more storage options than either the Galaxy S7 Edge or Pixel XL, and also delivers the largest storage quantity of the three phablet contenders. The iPhone 7 Plus benefits from a 256GB version of the smartphone, while the Pixel XL has a maximum capacity of 128 GB, with the Galaxy S7 Edge only offering a 64 GB version as its premium edition.Apple also offers consumers three separate versions of the iPhone 7 Plus, with 32 and 128GB models also available. This means that Apple has an advantage over the Android-driven competition in both the quantity and choice.Advantage: iPhone 7 PlusIt is always difficult to compare the cameras included in smartphones, as so many different attributes go together to deliver the overall photographic capabilities of such devices. However, we can examine the raw specifications of these three devices, and it could be suggested that the Google Pixel XL is the winner in this area.The Galaxy S7 Edge features a 12-megapixel snapper, which it has in common with the iPhone 7 Plus. The Pixel XL features a marginally more powerful 12.3-megapixel camera, meaning that it is able to capture slightly more detailed images than either the Apple or Samsung offerings.There are many other technical aspects to the three cameras, though, and it is not reasonable to merely assume that the Pixel XL is superior based on these figures alone. The Galaxy S7 Edge has been particularly praised for its picture-taking qualities, so while the raw specs of the Pixel XL are superior, it can be asserted that Samsung actually delivers the best photography experience.Advantage: Galaxy S7 EdgeEach of the three mobiles deliver video in 2160p format at 30fps. There is nothing to choose between them in this department.Advantage: TieThe Galaxy S7 Edge relies on a non-removable Li-Ion 3600 mAh battery, the Galaxy S7 Edge features a non-removable Li-Ion 2900 mAh battery, while the Pixel XL falls just short of the Galaxy S7 Edge with a non-removable Li-Ion 3450 mAh battery. Tests have also indicated that the Galaxy S7 Edge outperforms the other two devices in battery life performance.Advantage: Galaxy S7 EdgeSamsung has been acclaimed over the years for delivering smartphones with particularly outstanding specs, and the Galaxy S7 Edge is another example of this trend. While Apple relies on aesthetics and design, user-friendly features and an overall feeling of slickness, Samsung always delivers absolutely outstanding packages in terms of specifications. This means that the Galaxy S7 Edge is arguably the most outstanding performer in the phablet niche. And this will doubtless attract many consumers to the Android-driven phone over the Christmas and New Year period.One big black mark against the Galaxy S7 Edge is its paltry storage, which could dissuade those intending to hoard significant amounts of media on their smartphone.
