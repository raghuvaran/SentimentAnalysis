Apple always surprises its customers with innovative designs and features, but there is big suspense over next year’s iPhone (possibly the iPhone 8). KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who usually makes accurate predictions about Apple’s devices, has again made predictions on possibly the biggest iPhone change in years.In a research note, Kuo explains how Apple plans to overhaul the iPhone range.“We look for new 2017 iPhones to come in three models: one OLED model, and two TFT-LCD models with the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch display. We believe the OLED and 5.5-inch TFT-LCD iPhones will feature [a] dual-camera,” the analyst noted.A Barclays analyst also claimed this week that the next iPhone will sport an OLED screen and will be 5.8 inches in size. Provided that Kuo’s revelation is correct regarding the three distinct models, there are reasons for being happy and being sad at the same time, says Forbes contributor Gordon Kelly.The good part is that Apple will finally introduce an iPhone with an OLED screen. This will allow the company to make thinner devices, as it works without a backlight. Also it is lighter than the LCD panels used in current devices and is more energy efficient as well. The contrast ratio of an OLED is also higher than the LCD.The sad part is “further fragmentation of the premium iPhone line and continued sidelining of the popular and most affordable 4.7-inch iPhone model,” says Kelly.All major Apple rivals have been predominantly using OLED for several years now, and this move will be a catch-up in addition to a step up. Also Kelly says giving OLED to just one model with an even higher price tag risks alienating customers.Previously, there were rumors of a curved display or new form factor such as a bezel-less design, but Kuo did not mention those features. However, he did say that he expects the new iPhones will be made entirely of glass.Nothing is confirmed as of now, but we know for sure that this is just the beginning of rumors regarding the tenth anniversary iPhone, and going forward, there will be a lot more, as there is significant time left for the release of the next model.On Tuesday, Apple shares closed up 1.32% at $107.11. Year to date, the stock is up almost 2%, while in the last year, it is down almost 5%.
