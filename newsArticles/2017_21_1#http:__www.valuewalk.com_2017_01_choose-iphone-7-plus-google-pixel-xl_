The Google Pixel XL has received excellent reviews since it first appeared on the smartphone scene. But the Apple iPhone 7 Plus continues to clean up in the consumer marketplace. Surely there is some mistake? Isn’t the Pixel XL the greatest thing since sliced bread? Well, there are plenty of reasons to favor the Apple phablet over the Google device, so here are some of the reasons that customers continue to buy Apple.There is no doubt that the sound system in the Pixel XL is pretty decent, but the overwhelming consensus is that the iPhone 7 Plus speakers are simply superior. The stereo system included in the iPhone 7 Plus has been compared to the BoomSound Hi-Fi of the HTC 10, providing the Apple phablet with an extra kick in this department. The bass speaker and tweet included in the iPhone 7 Plus ensures that music and sound quality produced by this smartphone are simply outstanding, enhancing music, video and games and resulting in many happy iPhone consumers.It is somewhat ironic that the iPhone 7 Plus considerably outperforms the Google Pixel XL in this area, considering that Apple has often been criticized for the relatively paltry battery life of its mobiles. In tests, the iPhone 7 Plus delivered over nine hours of battery life on a single charge, which is around 20 percent more than the Google Pixel XL was able to deliver. It is surprising that there is such gulf between the two, but this can perhaps be explained by the superior screen resolution in the Google device.Nonetheless, not only does the iPhone 7 Plus deliver a superior battery life, but the iOS operating system does an excellent job at preventing battery percentages from slipping away while the phone is placed on standby. There is absolutely no doubt that the iPhone 7 Plus has a massive edge over the Google Pixel XL in this area.The telephoto lens included in the iPhone 7 Plus has been particularly lauded by those utilizing the phablet for photography. This provides true 2x zoom, while the new Portrait Mode has also been extremely well-received. Furthermore, the telephoto lens also has the advantage of not being a wide-angle camera, meaning that it does a much better job of taking portrait photographs. This is a very nifty aspect of the iPhone 7 Plus, and quite simply one that is not included in the Google Pixel XL.Apple made a big deal of the health-tracking capabilities of its product range in 2016, and among this was the inclusion of waterproofing in the iPhone 7 range. While the Pixel XL is pretty resilient in most respects, it is not actively water-resistant, or at least is not acknowledged as such by the manufacturer. The iPhone 7 is officially certified IP67 for water and dust-resistance, meaning that the phablet is simply more durable than its Google rival.While the Pixel XL will receive updates for at least two more years, with security updates lasting three years, the iPhone 7 Plus is guaranteed four years of software updates. This will ensure that the Apple phablet is functional until iOS 14 is released in 2020. On this basis, there is no doubt that the iPhone simply has a longer shelf life.It has long been stated that the iPhone is the slickest portfolio available on the market, and the iPhone 7 range was no exception to this rule. The iPhone 7 Plus has scored extremely well in Geekbench tests, with its score of 172,644 simply leaving the opposition in its dust. The Google Pixel XL is a nifty smartphone, but it nonetheless completely fails to compete with Apple’s flagship in this department.Smartphones are ultimately all about software, and the app range available for the Apple iPhone series is obviously completely unequalled. The Google Play App Store is more than decent, but it would be nothing short of a delusional to suggest that it can compete on an even footing with the Apple App Store. Apple created strong ties with developers from day one, and this has ensured that the iPhone range is still the definitive smartphone series in the world. It is almost completely implausible, in fact, the Google will ever catch up Apple in this department.While the Google Pixel XL is a pretty exciting device when first taken out of its box, over time it begins to slow down rather rapidly. There are various reasons for this, but what can be said in response is that Apple devices are notorious for retaining the same quality of performance over a staggering length of time. The MacBook series is particularly renowned for this quality, but it is almost equally applies to the iPhone 7 range as well.When one invests in an iPhone, it is almost an absolute certainty that it will last almost indefinitely. The only time one needs to ditch the iPhone is when Apple ceases to support it with software. In some cases even this is not necessary, with plenty of people still using rather dated Apple hardware, simply because it works as well as it ever did.Although Android has improved in recent years, the fact remains that it is still somewhat bloated compared to be beautifully simple and light weight iOS system, and this means that Android variants never run nor last quite as well as the iPhone.Again, there is absolutely no doubt that the Apple operating system is far more secure than any other mobile OS. This is really not open to debate, and has been completely proven statistically. No system can ever be completely secure, but the Apple operating system is simply miles ahead of any competitor, and this continues to attract both business and consumer customers.Finally, the combination of proprietary software and hardware in the iPhone range is an absolute killer, providing terrific integration and outstanding performance.
