Apple has not refreshed its iPod lineup since 2012. For months, there have been consistent rumors that the Cupertino company would release faster and better iPods this year. Now those rumors have gained more credibility, thanks to a new report from the very reliable French website iGen.fr. The French publication has learned from its sources that Apple would launch new iPod Touch, Shuffle, and Nano on or before Tuesday, July 14.Sources told iGen.fr that the iPod Touch, codenamed N102, would be a major update, while Shuffle (N12D) and Nano (N31A) may get only new colors. The new iPods are expected to arrive in six color options: space gray, silver, red, deep blue, light gold, and bright pink. Some of these color options were spotted in iTunes 12.2 earlier this month.The new iPod Touch will get newer internal components, including a 64-bit processor. From the images spotted in iTunes 12.2, the iPod Touch doesn’t seem to have the TouchID fingerprint sensor. It is expected to keep the 4-inch display. The current iPod Touch features an ultra-thin body, an A5 processor and lightening connector. It would be interesting to see whether the upgraded iPods could boost sales of Apple’s music players. iPod sales have been declining for years as consumers replace them with smartphones. The iPod Touch was last refreshed in 2012 and the iPod Shuffle in 2010. According to MacRumors, some people have reported noticing that the Calendar app on iPod Touch displays ‘Tuesday’ and ’14,’ which points to Tuesday, July 14. French website iGen.fr’s sources have also suggested the same date for the iPod refresh.The French publication has a very good track record of leaking details of Apple products before their official launch. Last year, it correctly predicted that the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus would go for sale on September 19. The new iPods are coming just weeks after the Cupertino company launched Apple Music.
