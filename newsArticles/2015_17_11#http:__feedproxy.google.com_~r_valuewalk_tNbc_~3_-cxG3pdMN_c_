All in all, Apple fell 12% in the third quarter and ended Sept. 30 at $110.30.Steady she goes — During the third quarter there were still a select few who didn’t change their stake in Apple at all. Activist investor Carl Icahn’s 52.8 million shares remained unchanged, as did Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management, which still held 7.6 million Apple shares.There is one contrarian — as other funds were selling off Apple shares, an unlikely hedge fund, Greenlight Capital upped is stake during the third quarter. Now owning 11.2 million Apple shares, an over 50% increase from its 7.2 million share stake in the second quarter.
