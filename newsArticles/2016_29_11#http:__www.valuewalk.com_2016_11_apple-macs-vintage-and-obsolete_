Apple PCs (or those from any other company, for that matter) do not last forever, and now it looks like the end has come for several Mac models. Even though the tech giant does not look like a slouch when it comes to supporting its products, it has to draw the line at some point. As a result, many Macs will be dropped from the support rolls on December 31, according to 9to5 Mac.iOS devices and PCs that are not repairable at resellers and Apple Stores anymore are called “vintage” or “obsolete.” Repair staff will no longer be able to order parts for Macs or iOS devices with these designations. According to the Apple, vintage products are those that “have not been manufactured for more than 5 and less than 7 years ago,” while obsolete products are “those that were discontinued more than 7 years ago.”The products that reached vintage status in Turkey and the U.S. and obsolescence everywhere else include the 17-inch (early 2011) and 15-inch MacBook Pro models. The 13-inch MacBook (mid-2009) and the Mac mini (early 2009) models reached obsolete status, says Digital Trends. Those who own any of the devices mentioned above should consider an upgrade, as these products will be ineligible for most official repairs.Apple keeps a list of obsolete and vintage products on its site. However, it does not usually inform customers when it makes an addition to that list. The last time the company added products to its list was in mid-October, and one of the most notable devices was the iPhone 4, which remained in use for many years.The status of Apple devices varies by region. For instance, the tech giant still provides support for iPods and iPhones in California online and via Apple Retail Stores and for Macs in California and all Apple products at Apple service providers in Turkey, says Digital Trends. However, obsolete devices are not provided support anywhere.On Monday, AAPL shares closed down 0.2% at $111.57.
