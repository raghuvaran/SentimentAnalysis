This affordable plan from BlackBerry offers extended coverage ranging from accidental damage to handling.Ron Louks, president of Devices and Emerging Solutions at BlackBerry, said the company is aware of the fact that users are productive mobile professionals who depend on their smartphones for day-long activity. Louks added that the plan will instill confidence among customers that repair costs are covered in case of any mechanical or electrical failure or damage from a liquid spill or accidental drop.Users can add the feature by making a monthly payment, and in turn receive peace of mind to focus on other features and not to worry about repair charges, said Louks.Users in the United States and Canada can sign up for the BlackBerry Care protection plan at a price of $3.49 per month for a BlackBerry Leap, $3.99 per month for a BlackBerry Classic and $4.49 per month for a BlackBerry Passport. Warrantech Corporation, an Amtrust Financial Company, is overseeing the BlackBerry Care protection plan.Apart from BlackBerry, rivals such as Apple, Samsung and Google also offer protection plans costing between $79 (iPhone) to $99 (Samsung and Nexus).The BlackBerry Care protection is a user-centric plan that shows an understanding of the busy life of mobile professionals. These professionals are always in a rush and consider their smartphones an essential tool for quick communication, collaboration and productivity. Therefore, the Canadian smartphone maker has come up with a plan that offers an additional year of coverage for defects that occur in a phone after the warranty period expires. It covers protection against accidental damage, spillage or breakage and offers the option of a smartphone replacement to minimize downtime in the event of a claim.The Waterloo, Ontario-based company has devised a simple and easy plan for its users. When a user pays for coverage, he or she will be assisted by a customer service representative in understanding the claim options, including delivery times and location.Users planning to sign up for the BlackBerry Protection plan can visit the company’s official website.
