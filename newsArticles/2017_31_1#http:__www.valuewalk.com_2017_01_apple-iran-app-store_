Apple has apparently begun to remove apps from Iran-based developers from its App Store, although it has yet to issue a statement on the matter. It appears to be the next shot in what looks to be a rocky future for relations between the U.S. and the Middle East, although it sounds like this might not have anything to do with the Trump administration’s ban on immigrants from Muslim-majority nations.The Next Web reports that a source aware of the situation confirmed that Apple is pulling down apps made by developers in Iran. TechRasa first reported on this earlier this week. The tech blog’s source clarified that any app developers operating in Iran will no longer be able to access Apple’s App Store. The source also stated that Apple will reject all apps made from developers located in Iran or who do business in the country.The Next Web’s source explained that the iPhone maker is complying with limitations to U.S. federal laws and doesn’t have anything to do with President Donald Trump’s executive to temporarily keep immigrants from Iran and six other Muslim-majority nations from entering the U.S.One of the most high-profile apps that has been removed is DigiKala, and although it’s been a few days since it disappeared from the App Store, Apple has yet to provide any official reason for it. However, the company is reportedly sending notices to Iranian developers whose apps were rejected, stating that those which are “facilitating transactions for businesses or entities based in Iran may not comply with the Iranian Transactions Sanctions Regulations (31CFR Part 560) when hosted on the Apple Store.”The iPhone maker still doesn’t have an official App Store in Iran, according to Apple Insider, although it quietly opened the store to iOS users there in September. It seemed as if the company was gradually removing some of the limitations on the distribution platform, but the notice it sent to Iranian developers whose apps were rejected makes it appear as if the problem is related to the lack of an official App Store there.Developers in Iran have been able to dodge the issue regarding access to the App Store by just registering their apps to other countries.
