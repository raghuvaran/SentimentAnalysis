Apple is looking to debut its new music service in Russia also, according to the latest reports. The iPhone maker has been working on expanding its service in various countries around the world in June, and the latest entrant in that list could be Russia, suggests a report from Billboard.A Russian newspaper, citing some of the biggest Russian record labels, reported on negotiations between them and Apple and said that Russia will be the first country to get the service. The iPhone maker is reportedly working on deals with domestic labels to expand its digital rights to streaming services. The latest report does not talk about if the deal with Russia is limited to only streaming music or to the iTunes Radio as well.At present, users in Russia can access music, movies, apps and books through iTunes and iTunes Match. As of now, Apple is running Beats Music only in the U.S., whereas iTunes Radio can be accessed in Australia and the U.S. At the time of the launch of iTunes in 2013, the Cupertino, Calif.-based company stated that it will offer the service in various other countries. Apple iTunes Chief Eddy Cue stated that the global launch of iTunes was the top priority and that the service will be delivered to more than 100 countries. Although no reason can be pointed out with certainty behind the failure of the global rollout plan of Apple’s iTunes, the inability of the company to ink a deal with many countries around the world could be a probable reason.Meanwhile, Apple is gearing up to roll out new changes for iTunes Radio and Beats Music. The new version of iTunes Radio is expected to have advanced curation, and exclusive radio shows will be hosted by popular DJs. BBR radio DJ Zane Lowe was roped in by the company this year, along with other radio content producers. However, the idea could be to make the service even more entertaining through better customization toward regional markets.The new service from Apple will supposedly be similar to the existing Beats Music service with more inclination toward curated content and artist exclusives. Both services are expected to make their debut in June during Apple’s Worldwide Developers’ Conference.
