Apple is planning to hold an iPad event in March, where it would show off the new iPad Pro lineup. But the company may unveil more than just new iPad Pro 2 models at the event. Sources familiar with the matter told Japanese publication Mac Otakara that Apple would also launch red iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, and a 128GB model of the iPhone SE.It’s not the first time rumors of a red color iPhone have surfaced. In December last year, Mac Otakara reported that Apple was working on red iPhones. But the publication said at the time that the red color would debut only with the iPhone 7S and 7S Plus in September. Mac Otakara said in its latest report that the red color option is coming with the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus in March as Apple is trying to boost sales mid-cycle ahead of the iPhone 8 unveiling.The red color variant could be part of Apple’s (PRODUCT) RED initiative. Profits from the RED products go towards providing counseling, testing, and medicines to prevent the spread of AIDS. Mac Otakara did not reveal the date and place of Apple’s March event. Since the company’s “spaceship” campus is almost complete, the March event could be held at Apple’s new corporate headquarters.Previously, there were speculations that Apple would not refresh its 4-inch iPhone SE, which comes in 16GB and 64GB storage options. Supply chain sources told Mac Otakara that Apple was planning to launch a 128GB model of the iPhone SE next month. An increase in storage capacity means the handset may have the same internal components as the original iPhone SE released last year.The star of the show will be four new iPad Pro models: 7.9-inch, 9.7-inch, 10.5-inch, and 12.9-inch. Sources told the publication that the 10.5-inch version wouldn’t ship until May, but the others would start shipping in March. The report indicates that the 7.9-inch iPad Pro could succeed the iPad Mini 4. The 10.5-inch model will have a new form factor with an edge-to-edge display and no home button.The 10.5-inch iPad Pro is said to have the same dimensions as the 9.7-inch variant due to its edge-to-edge display. Mac Otakara said in a previous report that the 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2 would sport a True Tone display and 12-megapixel main camera. A True Tone display can automatically adjust the color and intensity of the screen to match the light of the surrounding environment.All the upcoming iPads are said to feature quad microphones. Sources told Mac Otakara that the 7.9-inch iPad Pro would feature a Smart Connector, a True Tone display, and a 12MP main camera as Apple aims to standardize features across the iPad lineup.
