Apple’s iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone 6s are both troubling their owners. Last week, the company launched a repair program for the “touch disease” flaw affecting the iPhone 6 Plus, and now, it has launched one for the iPhone 6s to help users affected by a flaw in the battery which leads to an unexpected shutdown, reports 9to5 Mac.The iPhones affected by the battery flaw are few and are those manufactured between September and October 2015. The owners of the affected units can get their batteries replaced free of charge. Apple also pointed out that this issue has nothing to do with users’ safety.“Apple has determined that a very small number of iPhone 6s devices may unexpectedly shut down. This is not a safety issue and only affects devices within a limited serial number range that were manufactured between September and October 2015,” the iPhone maker says.Customers who find that their devices’ batteries are affected by this flaw should visit an Apple Retail Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider to get their eligibility for the program confirmed. After this, they can have their battery replaced free of charge, the iPhone maker says.As usual, Apple made it clear that devices with other damage such as a cracked screen are not eligible for the repair program until the other damage is repaired. The company will refund the cost of the battery replacement to customers who already paid to get it replaced because of this flaw. Such owners should contact customer support.Apple’s repair program comes just days after the China Consumers Association asked the U.S. firm to look into the battery problem. The organization also suggested that the issue is causing problems on both the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6. However, Apple is covering just the defective iPhone 6s units under this program.For the iPhone 6s Plus, the company launched a separate program. Several iPhone 6 Plus owners were dealing with the so-called “touch disease” problem, due to which the screens of the devices began to flicker or lose touch sensitivity. Under this repair program, Apple is charging $149 because it claims that part of the problem is due to careless handling of the device by owners.
