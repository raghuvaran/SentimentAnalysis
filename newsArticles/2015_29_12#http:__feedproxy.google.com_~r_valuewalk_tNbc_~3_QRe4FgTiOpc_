Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) devices dominated the holiday gift-giving season. According to a recent study, iPhones and iPads accounted for 49.1% of new device activations in the week that led up to Christmas.On Monday, Flurry — an analytics firm owned by Yahoo — publishedstatistics showing that over the week of Dec. 19 through Dec. 25, Apple enjoyed a big lead in new device activations for two consecutive years. However, performance is down 2.2% from last year when the iPhone firm released the larger-screened iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus phablet.Next was Samsung with a 19.8% share of all new device activations this year, higher by 2.1% from 2014. The Korean firm benefited from Apple’s dip in seasonal market share. Nokia was at the third spot with a market share of 2%. LG had a 1.7% share, and Xiaomi had a 1.5%, rounding out the top five.On breaking down the results by device, we get to see that Apple again leads the pack. The larger 5.5-inch iPhone 6s Plus accounted for 12% all the Apple device activations over the week.Adoption of Apple’s phablet has been really fast, but it has come at the expense of smaller devices from the company such as the 4.7-inch iPhone 6s and small tablets like the iPad mini. Of all iOS device activations, 9% came from the iPad mini, according to Flurry.The scenario was a bit different last year when the phablet’s adoption came at the expense of tablet sales and not the smaller smartphones. Phablet sales surged during the season, but despite that, a major share of the iOS device activations (65%) came from the 4.7-inch iPhone 6s and iPhone 6. Full size tablets, including the iPad Pro, accounted for 14%. Flurry informed readers that less than 1% of device activations came from Apple’s jumbo iPad.App downloads also took place in large numbers on Christmas Day. App downloads on Christmas were 2.2 times higher than the average daily installs across the board for the first three weeks of December, said Flurry. Such a huge increase in app sales on Christmas Day makes sense if we consider all the new devices activated.      On Monday, Apple shares closed down 1.12% at $106.82. Year to date, the stock is down by over 3%.
