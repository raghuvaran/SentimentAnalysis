When Apple unveiled the Apple Watch Series 1 and Series 2 last month, its chief operating officer Jeff Williams said the Series 1 had the same dual-core processor as Series 2, so it’s just as snappy. There are several differences between the Apple Watch Series 2 and Series 1. But, it turns out, speed is not one of them. The Cupertino company has discontinued the original Apple Watch.If you just want a faster Apple Watch, you can go for the Series 1. Good folks at 9to5Mac conducted a real-life test of the new Watch models. They found that the two devices were equally fast when it came to using Siri, launching apps, and performing other tasks. Though Apple had confirmed that the Series 1 is “just as snappy” as Series 2, some believed that the higher priced Series 2 was faster. The dual-core processor used in Series 1 is called S1P, while the chipset in Series 2 is called the S2. The difference between the two is that S2 has a built-in GPS. 9to5Mac found that the presence of GPS has no impact on speed. Despite the same performance level, there are still many reasons to opt for the Apple Watch Series 2 over Series 1, which doesn’t have much new in terms of features.The Series 2 has a new air vent on the side. It has built-in GPS for those regularly engaging in outdoor workouts. Also, the Series 2 has a better second-generation OLED Retina display, which is more than 2x brighter at 1000 nits compared to the original Apple Watch at 450 nits. A brighter screen makes it easier to see the content on the screen even in bright sunlight.The Apple Watch Series 2 is water-resistant up to 50 meters for 30 minutes. It also comes with a Pool Swim workout mode, which is not available in Series 1. The Water Lock functionality can force water out of the speaker using sound waves after a swim.Despite all the new features in Apple Watch Series 2, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes that Apple Watch sales in 2016 will be lower than in 2015. It’s worth noting that the wearable device was available only for eight months last year, and this time it will be available for a full 12 months. Ming-Chi Kuo estimates that the total Apple Watch shipments in 2016 will be 8.5-9 million units. Apple had sold 10.4 million units in 2015.The analyst said in a research note to investors that Apple Watch Series 2 sales will rise by 10%-15%. But it won’t be enough to make up for the poor Series 1 sales. Kuo said Apple Watch sales are still driven by hardcore Apple fans rather than by the mass market. The analyst blamed the lack of killer apps, reliance on iPhone, not-so-good battery life, and a multi-touch UI for the poor sales of new Watch models.
