Rumors about the iPhone 8 display size have been a bit confusing. Back in October last year, Japanese business publication Nikkei claimed that the 10th anniversary iPhone would feature a 5-inch OLED display, while the iPhone 7S and 7S Plus would stick to the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screen sizes. However, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reported that the iPhone 8 would pack a 5.8-inch OLED screen.Kuo added that the 5.8-inch display would fit in the same dimensions as the 4.7-inch iPhone 7, thanks to its bezel-less display. In subsequent research notes, the analyst reported that only 5.15-inch of the 5.8-inch would be the actual display area. The remaining real estate at the bottom would house a new “function area” that would offer dynamic controls depending on the app you are using.Now Nikkei Asian Review has switched its course, saying that the iPhone 8 would indeed have a 5.8-inch display. It added that the 10th anniversary iPhone would significantly increase the average selling price (ASP) for iPhones. If recent reports are to be believed, the iPhone 8 is going to cost more than $1,000. Nikkei pointed out that the Chinese smartphone sales growth has been slowing, making customers in the country less likely to shell out more money for the new iPhone.Since the iPhone 8 is going to feature a 5.8-inch OLED screen with the actual usable display area of 5.15-inch, it would be interesting to see whether Apple categorizes it as a 5.1-inch, 5.2-inch, or 5.8-inch smartphone. Apple is said to remove the iconic home button to make room for a bigger display without increasing the phone’s dimensions. The fingerprint scanner will reportedly be embedded in the display itself.The next-gen iPhone was previously rumored to come with a curved display that would wrap around the edges. But Chinese research firm TrendForce reported last month that the curved screen did not perform well in drop tests. That, coupled with low yield rates, has prompted Apple to drop the idea of a curved display. Another report claimed last week that the iPhone 8 might not enter mass production until September due to OLED supply constraints. Apple is looking for additional OLED suppliers besides Samsung.A new patent granted to Apple by the USPTO describes how the in-display fingerprint scanner would work. It would eliminate the need to have a “separate authentication step” where users have to move the finger to the home button to authenticate. It would scan your fingerprint during the normal use. However, it’s not the only in-display fingerprint scanning technology Apple has patented.According to UBS Securities analyst Steven Milunovich, the iPhone 8 would feature augmented reality. The Cupertino company has about 1,000 augmented reality experts working on AR-related projects in Israel, said the analyst.
