Apple has expanded the storage capacity of the iPhone 6 and re-launched it in India (and a few other Asian countries), although it was a hush-hush affair, according to Gadgets Now. The U.S. firm launched the same gold-colored variant in China, and it will officially be sold through Taiwan Mobile starting March 10.On Amazon India, the 32 GB Space Grey iPhone 6 is available for 28,999 ($435). During its launch in 2014, the iPhone was available in 16GB, 64GB and 128GB storage options. However, the company pulled all the variants after the launch of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Interested buyers can also take advantage of the exchange offer on the handset.Amazon notes this as an introductory price and a limit-time offer. As of now, the relaunched variant is being offered by third parties and not at the exclusive Apple store, offline or online, according to Gadgets Now.There is no doubt about the fact that the iPhone 6 is loaded with some of the best features. The model has a 4.7-inch HD Retina display. Further, the phone houses A8 chipsets with a 1.8GHZ capacity and 1GB of RAM. The iPhone 6’s rear camera is 8MP, and the front-facing camera is 1.2MP. The phone is powered by a 1,810 mAh battery with connectivity options including Bluetooth, NFC, GPS and a 3.5 mm headphone jack.The California-based company is not expected to launch this model indeveloped markets and will continue promoting its iPhone SE, which was launched in March 2016. Further, some believe that like the iPhone 6, the iPhone SE will also be beefed up with extra storage during an expected launch event later this month.Meanwhile, the buzz is heightened around the launch of the iPhone 8, which is expected to launch in September. A few days ago, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo stated that Apple is facing significant issues in manufacturing the high-end OLED screen phone in time because there is “there is virtually no time to make changes to the 3D camera system” before the September launch.According to Kuo, one alternative could be to launch two variants of the iPhone 7 and later launch the iPhone 8 which will come packed with the OLED screen. However, this would be a big departure from what Apple usually does. Nevertheless, this highly-anticipated iPhone will probably be worth the wait.
