As excitement builds about the impending announcement of the next generation iPhone, rumors abound that it may be available in a new colorway.It is thought that Apple will announce the new iPhone on September 7, but it is not yet clear whether it will be known as the iPhone 6s or the iPhone 7. Whatever it’s name, it seems likely that a new color option will be available.Although several rumors say that a pink option will be available, 9to5Mac thinks it is more likely to be “rose gold.” Mark Gurman, who writes for the site, claims that the front of the rose gold iPhone will be white.The rose gold colorway is currently available on the 18-karat rose gold Apple Watch, although that version is made of real rose gold. It seems unlikely that the Apple iPhone will be made of the precious metal itself.Commentators believe that the rose gold iPhone will have the same matte anodized aluminum texture as the existing silver, space gray and gold versions. Gurman believes that a rose gold iPhone will actually appear to have more of a copper color.Leaked images reportedly show rose gold iPhone prototypes, but since Apple has not issued an official comment it is impossible to say whether the reports are true, or if the photos were edited on Photoshop.Aside from a new colorway, it is widely predicted that the new iPhone will feature Force Touch technology. Force Touch allows the hardware to differentiate between a hard touch and a soft touch, and therefore offers more options to users who wish to activate certain apps or features within those apps.Commentators are also predicting an upgrade to the iPhone camera, which some say could be a significant improvement over existing technology. Apple is also reportedly planning to boost performance with a faster A9 processor, which will improve LTE performance and battery life.There have also been rumors that the construction process will be modified to prevent the smartphone from bending as much as the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. As the overall design is very similar to the existing iPhone, Apple is relying on technological advances to encourage users to invest in the next generation smartphone.Apple has confirmed that it will unveil the phone at a press event on September 9. Although the company traditionally uses the 755-capacity Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco, the company is using a different venue this time around.A booking has been made at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium, which can hold 7,000 people, driving the rumor mill into overdrive. Analysts are speculating as to why Apple might need so much more space, although its clear that the company has something big planned.Alongside the new iPhone, the company is expected to unveil its new Apple TV set-top box, which may have Siri built-in, a touchpad controller and its own App Store. In addition, some believe that a new iPad Pro may be unveiled at the same event.The latest edition of Apple’s tablet is expected to feature a huge 12 or 13 inch screen and a detachable keyboard. Analysts believe that it could breathe new life into the 2-in-1 tablet market.
