A Japanese woman has found an innovative way to revenge on her cheating partner. When Twitter user @foolishnessfly2 learned that her boyfriend was seeing someone else behind her back, she decided to hurt him where it hurts the most. Her partner was an Apple fanboy, amassing all the products that the Cupertino company releases and taking pride that he owned every overpriced gadget designed in Cupertino.The scorned girlfriend got a sweet revenge on her boyfriend by dumping his entire collection of Apple devices in the bath. The collection included two MacBooks, an iPad, a couple of iPhones, an iMac, and accessories – all soaked in soapy water. All these Apple products were collectively worth thousands of dollars. On top of that, she knew how to add insult to injury.She then took photos of the drowned Apple products and tweeted them for all to see. She also sent the photos to her lying lover. At the time of writing this post, her tweet was retweeted 15,900 times and had over 10,000 favorites. Her cheating boyfriend learned it the hard way that hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.?????????????????????????? pic.twitter.com/IhHw7IMYYZ— ????? (@foolishnessfly2) April 18, 2015We all know that a gadget’s contact with water causes it a painful death. This Japanese woman put her boyfriend’s prized Apple collection into a watery grave. Even leaving his devices in uncooked rice for two days is unlikely to help him much. Twitteratti has given a mixed response to this women’s way of taking revenge. While some said that destroying her partner’s Apple collection was harsh, others supported the woman.Some Twitter users called it “the best revenge.” One of them said, “Haha, makes you think twice about cheating on your significant other.” Twitter user @babysdoc voiced in favor of the woman’s methods, saying “You go, girl!” Most of the other comments were in Japanese, and Google’s translate button was of little help.
