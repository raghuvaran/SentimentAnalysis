Apple and IBM are teaming up for a very special project. The companies plan to donate 5 million iPads to senior citizens in Japan.The iPads will come with specially designed software to manage important things like healthcare or other needs. The IBM-designed apps range from medication reminders to job matching. Apple CEO Tim Cook added that he has plans to improve the lives of millions of people because eventually everyone reaches old age.Cook opened up about this plans alongside IBM CEO Ginni Rometti, Japan Post CEO Taizo Nishimuro and their initiative partners. The move is primarily an example of both companies attempting to invade new areas, including health and business. Right now, Apple’s best products remain the iPhone and Mac. Unfortunately, the company has been losing a significant amount of revenues with the iPad. Earlier this week, it was reported that the iPad sold a total of 12.6 million units–a number below Wall Street’s expectations. It was also the fifth consecutive quarterly decline.Last July, Apple made a deal with IBM to reach businesses with Apple products. IBM’s focus in the deal involves optimizing cloud computing services for iOS. The list of services includes management, security and analytics. Both companies also introduced a range of apps for many industries, including banking, government and airlines.Japan Post will distribute the iPads as part of its Watch Over service. The agency is responsible for postal, insurance and banking services within the country. This offering works by sending employees to visit the homes of customers for a well-being check for a monthly fee. The program will start in the latter half of this year. It is expected to reach a total of 4 million to 5 million customers in five yearsApple aims to improve everyone’s lives with special initiatives like this.
