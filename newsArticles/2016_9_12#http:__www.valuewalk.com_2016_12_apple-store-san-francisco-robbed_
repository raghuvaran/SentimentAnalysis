An Apple Store has been robbed, and it took merely 12 seconds for the culprits to do it. All of it was captured by a CCTV camera. Last week, The San Francisco Police department released a video revealing what happened in the hope that someone might identify the culprits.Robberies at Apple stores have been quite common these days. For example, a few weeks ago, a similar incident took place at the Fourth Street Apple Store in Berkeley, California, where the thieves carried out three robberies in the store in nine days, grabbing whatever they could get their hands on, says CNET.Similar robberies took place at another Bay Area Apple Store (Chestnut Street in San Francisco) on November 25 and 29. Though the incidents were quite similar to the Fourth Street one, the speed at which the entire incident took place was notable, notes CNET. In the first robbery, three men walked into the store wearing hoodies and took whatever they could in 12 seconds.In the second, four men were involved, performing the same actions in about the same time. Staff and customers merely watched the robbers rip off the gadgets from the tables and run, says CNET. No arrests have been made until now, informed a San Francisco Police Department spokeswoman.As of now, there has been no comment from Apple about the matter. Footage of the robbery can be viewedhere.In other Apple news, rumors that the iPhone maker could be preparing a radical new type of device gained momentum after the company was granted another patent for a folding phone on Thursday. Motorola was the first to introduce flip phones in the 1990s, and many believe the design might influence future iPhones.According to the patent, the proposed handset will have a hinge in the middle, enabling owners to bend it in half. On one of the several versions listed in the patent, the support structure will be made of a flexible nitinol, a nickel and titanium alloy, suggests the patent document.In one of the versions, when the phone is folded from the middle, the screen is no longer visible, similar to the clamshell phones of the past. Another version leaves the screen visible but reduced to half its actual size.According to Patently Apple, Apple has been granted 39 new patents yesterday by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
