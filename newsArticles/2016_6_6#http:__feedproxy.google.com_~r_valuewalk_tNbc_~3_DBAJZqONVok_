Apple’s WWDC 2016 conference is almost with us, in-fact we’ve got exactly a week to wait and as always with big tech events like this, what we know about them changes almost daily. Last week I and my colleagues here at Valuewalk were reporting about all the software and hardware launches we had expected Apple to announce at WWDC. However, it looks as though the event this year could actually revert back to what it was originally intended for, software updates!Like I said before, the information I and my colleagues get is always open to change! So, if you were getting excited about a possible iPhone 7 launch at this year’s WWDC, I’m sorry to say that it looks unlikely to happen.However, this hardware hold back does not just effect the iPhone, as I’m seeing reports from many different sources, which suggest that the Apple Watch 2 will also not get its supposed spot in the limelight at the conference too.Other pieces of hardware, which had been not spoken about in as much detail, but will also not be unveiled at the conference are Apple TV and the Apple Car. However, what you can expect is some other event in the not so distant future to pick up these pieces of Apple kit and show them off the the world.As I mentioned earlier, it looks as though Apple has decided to use the developer conference for its original purpose. And that is to launch new software updates for its leading products. Likely to be seen at the WWDC are updates for iOS, OS X, Siri, Watch OS and a possible new OS for Apple TV.So here’s a break down of what I know about each Software update….According to one of my colleagues here at Valuewalk Michelle Jones, Siri will take the spotlight at this year’s event. Also other reports are suggesting that developers will be able to get their hands on to a Siri SDK, which will enable them to produce applications that can be further integrated with the virtual personal assistant.Sometimes it is easy to forget that Apple isn’t just a tech firm with mobile products. It also as a line of extremely successful laptops called MacBook’s and it’s with these that we could start to see a merging of softwares.Siri is reportedly being ported over to the MacBook, this means Apple’s personal assistant will be finally moving across to the big screen and following in the footsteps of Microsoft counterpart Cortana. At WWDC it is expected that OS X 10.12 will be announced and this is where Siri and other possible cross-overs from the world of mobile could make their way to the Mac.Other pieces of software which could port across are, extended Apple pay functionality, redesigned iTunes and the fingerprint sensor software Touch ID.One piece of software, which has many people excited is iOS 10, this new OS has been anticipated for some time now with speculation running rife over the last few months. Whether Siri takes the limelight or not, one thing is for sure and that’s the fact that iOS 10 will offer some huge updates that will feature across the entire Apple device ecosystem.With Apple Music, likely to be getting an almost complete overhaul, including a redesign and a major UI improvement. In other rumors Apple pay is said to be becoming further integrated into web browsers. Meaning that it could become a fully fledged mobile web payment service provider. In-fact as far as iOS 10 is concerned there are a whole raft of update rumors doing the rounds.So that’s it for the moment, those where the latest software rumors doing the rounds about what we can expect at WWDC 2016. My advice to you prior to the events opening day on the 13th, is to keep your eyes peeled and follow mine and my colleagues updates here on Valuewalk.
