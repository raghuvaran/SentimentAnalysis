Apple’s iPhone 6 and 6 Plus have made a strong base in the United States, claims Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, LLC. By the end of the March quarter, 94 million iPhones were being used in the U.S., including 25 million iPhone 6 and 13 million iPhone 6 Plus.Apple CEO Tim Cook stated during a recent investor call that there is a significant number of iPhone users who have not upgraded to the 6 or 6 Plus. Cook, citing the company’s own estimates, said around 40% of U.S. iPhone owners have upgraded to the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus. Cook further mentioned that there are 56 million U.S. iPhone owners with older models who have yet to upgrade.Data suggests the penetration rates of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus into the market after the launch. According to the estimates, 38 million of these flagship phones have been sold in the U.S. from September 2014 through March 31, 2015. For the iPhone 5S, the number was 18 million for 2013-2014.Currently around 26 million iPhone 5S models are still in use, but these phones were purchased 18 months ago, so owners will probably upgrade them in the coming quarters, says the report. Also around 8 million iPhone 4S models dating back to 2011 are still in use.CIRP compiled the data after analyzing iPhone buyers, model selection and their previous phones along with iPhone sales data adjusted to the United States market. CIRP’s findings are based on a March 2015 survey of 500 U.S. customers who purchased an Apple product (iPhone, iPad, or Mac computer) in the preceding quarter.Separately, Apple unveiled a new iPhone lightning dock that’s compatible with the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. Owing to competition, Apple plans to sell the new Lightning Charging Dock for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus for $39, and delivery is expected within one to three days. It is strange that the company released the charging dock nine months after the latest iPhones hit the market.Various reports suggest that Apple is already looking forward to the release of its next-generation iPhone. Chinese site UDN suggests that the new models of the phone (iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus) could be launched in July; if true, it would be ahead of the usual September launch.
