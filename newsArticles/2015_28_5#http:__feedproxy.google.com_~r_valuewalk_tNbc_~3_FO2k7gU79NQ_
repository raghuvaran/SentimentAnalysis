The Apple Store now offers same-day delivery service for select products ordered through the Apple Store app. Unfortunately, the service is available exclusively to customers in the San Francisco area.Some of the products, as noted on the app, have delivery times as short as one hour. Such products available for same-day delivery include iPhone USB cables and the Apple TV. The new service is part of the Cupertino-based tech giant’s partnership with the on-demand delivery company Postmates.Apple’s same-day delivery service is a great idea for those who want or need accessories sooner than usual delivery times. Bay Area residents who tried out the service claimed some of their items arrived within a 30-minute time frame, but others took an entire day to arrive. The service has yet to be formally announced by Apple. It’s reported that the service starts today.Postmates is a same-day delivery service that operates in many major cities throughout the United States, including San Francisco, Los Angeles and Miami.The service mainly delivers food and groceries, but it also delivers non-edible items. It works with local companies and popular chains, including Starbucks, McDonald’s, Walgreens, and Whole Foods. The service previously delivered Apple products, but this is the first time Apple Store app users can choose same-day delivery directly on the app.Postmates operates like Uber as it uses contractors to deliver the goods. Earlier this year, the company’s CEO stated that the company has over 10,000 couriers.Apple plans to open up a new retail store on Manhattan’s Upper East Side next month. The new store will occupy an old bank building located at 940 Madison Avenue. The entire building is quite large with a 4,000 square-foot ground level and 1,000 square foot mezzanine. It will be the seventh Apple store in the entire New York City area.
