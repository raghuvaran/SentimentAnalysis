Since Donald Trump’s surprise win in the presidential race, there’s been virtual carnage among the FANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google/ Alphabet) and other major tech names. The widespread belief is that his policies will be bad for them, but analysts are generally saying that it’s time to buy the pullback in these big tech names.Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Youssef Squali highlighted a number of areas which could be good or bad for the FANG stocks and their fellow tech or Internet names. One area he  mentioned in his Nov. 16 report was net neutrality, which President-elect Trump has said he is against. Squali sees a risk to some key Internet names such as Netflix because Trump is expected to appoint an FCC chairman who thinks like he does.As a result, if the net neutrality ruling is overhauled, Internet service providers might throttle delivery speeds for some content unless they pay. All four FANG stocks could take a hit from this because all four deal in video, so if the net neutrality ruling is changed, they may have to pay up or else see the quality of their videos suffer. Netflix, Alphabet’s YouTube and Amazon Prime Video may be at the most risk, with Facebook and also Twitter be affected to a lesser degree. However, as Facebook and Twitter continue to grow their live-streaming businesses, this is an issue that could affect them more and more.A key concern not only for Internet names but also anyone who’s concerned about immigration and international affairs is Trump’s strong protectionist views. China has already threatened to retaliate by cutting iPhone sales if he makes good on his promise of a 45% tariff on all goods imported from China.It’s no secret that most large U.S.-based tech names rake in large chunks of their sales outside the country. Western Europe is usually the biggest market, with Japan in second place and then emerging markets, explains Squali, especially Brazil and India. The analyst adds that China only makes up a “small percentage” of revenues for the four FANG names, if any at all. He notes that only Amazon and Alphabet are even in China, and those businesses are relatively small compared to the rest of their global businesses. As a result, he sees limited impact on the FANG stocks if anything happens with China.Apple, a tech favorite that isn’t part of FANG, stands to take a bigger hit if China does lash out at it for Trump’s policies. The company produces most of its products there, and it considers China to be an important market for it. However, sales have already been plunging there, so if that trend continues, it may have nothing to do with Trump’s protectionist views.Trump also aims to reward U.S. companies that repatriate their cash, so it seems likely that he will offer a tax holiday or perhaps reform corporate tax law in order to incentivize companies to bring their cash home. Alphabet, Facebook and Amazon all have overseas cash stockpiles. Squali believes that most companies that are able to repatriate their cash at a better tax rate such as 10% to 15% rather than the statutory rate of 35% to 40% will do so and then use the proceeds for investment, mergers and acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases.Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi and team ran the numbers to see just how much some of the biggest tech names would benefit from repatriating their overseas cash and from corporate tax reform. In the case of a one-time tax holiday on cash repatriation, they found that Microsoft and Qualcomm had low tax rates and lots of offshore cash.As a result, they would benefit more from being able to repatriate cash than they might from corporate tax reform. Microsoft has so much cash ($111 billion) overseas that it would benefit from bringing it home at a lower tax rate, although the smaller size of Qualcomm’s $30 billion overseas cash pot means that repatriation would be less of a benefit for it. Microsoft’s 17% corporate tax rate and Qualcomm’s 18% tax rate mean that if corporate taxes are reduced to 15%, it would be less of a benefit for them.Of the FANG stocks, the Bernstein team reports that Alphabet has 10% of its market cap offshore, while Amazon has only 2% overseas and Facebook has just 1% held outside the U.S.The Bernstein team said Apple could be a huge winner in both corporate tax reform and a tax holiday because it has a high tax rate of 26% and a massive pile of $216 billion in cash overseas. The iPhone maker’s tax rate is 26%, and its overseas cash hoard is $216 billion. In fact, that cash stack is so much that Apple could potentially repatriate about 37% of its market capitalization, according to the Bernstein team. The only company that could repatriate a greater percentage of its market cap is Cisco Systems.Of the FANG stocks, they only see Amazon as having any measurable benefit from Trump’s proposed tax reforms.
