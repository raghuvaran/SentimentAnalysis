Apple is scheduled to release its March quarter earnings report after closing bell tonight, and investors appear to be expecting upside to estimates.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is doing.Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) guided for revenue of between $52 billion and $55 billion for its second fiscal quarter, but RBC Capital analyst Amit Daryanani and his team are expecting to see $55.4 billion.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)’s iPhone unit number very closely. Daryanani said he thinks the sell-side is looking for 56 million iPhone units while the buy-side is expecting about 60 million units. They may be a bit high on that buy-side estimate, however.White, known for his ultra-bullish stance and high $180 per share price target on Apple Inc.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)’s current channel fill for both the iPhone and Apple Watch so that they can understand the dynamics of the inventory. They also want to learn more about the size of opportunity the Apple Watch offers for the company and early feedback on the device.Foreign exchange rates are expected to continue weighing on Apple’s results, both in the March and June quarters.
