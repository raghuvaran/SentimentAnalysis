On Tuesday, Greenpeace released their annual report of digital companies and their environmental impact and for the third year in a row, Apple topped the list. What sets Apple apart was their commitment to renewable energy, specifically in their offices and manufacturing sites. Other companies that were near the top were Google, Facebook and a data center operator called Switch. Near the bottom were video streaming companies like HBO, Netflix and Amazon. This is a result of the massive amount of electricity needed for their servers, which handle the streaming and transmitting of the videos.Â Apple is focusing its rumored interest in the augmented reality space on creating a new pair of AR glasses with Carl Zeiss, claims well-known blogger Robert Scoble in a Facebook post. Apple is said to have contacted suppliers about the project, which appears to be in the exploratory prototyping phase of development. While Scoble believes the glasses could be released in 2017, previous information points towards a 2018 or later release.
