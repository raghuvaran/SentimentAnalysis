Apple has released iOS 8.4, and as always, with it comes the need for a jailbreak. Since the launch of the first iPhone, developers have made it their mission to jailbreak any version of iOS, and they work really hard to do that. Apple’s latest mobile operating system, iOS 8.4, was jailbroken just a few hours after its release, thanks to the TaiG team.With iOS 8.4, the Cupertino company also brought support for Apple’s new streaming service, Apple Music. Many people were waiting to try out this Spotify competitor from Apple, and with the launch of iOS 8.4, they can finally do so.The TaiG team was the first to jailbreak the iOS 8.4 beta. Many users feared that Apple would patch the exploit that TaiG used. However, when iOS 8.4 was launched, thankfully Apple had not patched the exploit, and because of that, within a few hours of the release of iOS 8.4, the TaiG team released the jailbreak.TaiG v2.3 supports mostly all iOS devices, such as the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 5s, iPhone 5c, iPhone 5, iPhone 4s, iPad 4/3/2, iPad Mini 3/2/1, iPad Air 2/1 and iPod Touch 5. The official site states that the “TaiG Jailbreak V2.3.0 supports iOS 8.1.3-iOS 8.4 untethered jailbreak,” which means any device running on iOS 8.1.3 to iOS 8.4 can be jailbroken using this tool.Right now TaiG’s jailbreak tool is only available for Windows users. Mac users can run Windows on a virtual machine and then launch this tool to jailbreak their iOS device from their Mac. You can head over to the official website of TaiG to download this tool and jailbreak your iOS 8.4 device.Note: It is always a good idea to back up your iOS device before jailbreaking it. We would highly recommend that you back up your device so that if something goes wrong, you can restore it from the backup.
