Though Apple unveiled the 12.9-inch iPad Pro alongside the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, the jumbo tablet is yet to hit the stores. Now a report coming out of Apple’s supply chain in Asia suggests that the company is taking a “rather conservative attitude” about the iPad Pro sales. Supply chain sources told Digitimes that the Cupertino-based tech giant has placed “limited orders” for the tablets for the crucial holiday shopping season.According to Digitimes, Apple has placed orders for less than 2.5 million units for the end of 2015, clearly signalling that the company doesn’t expect it to be a blockbuster. Beyond that, Apple will be taking a wait-and-watch approach to decide volume for the first quarter of 2016. Sources told Digitimes that the Q1, 2016 orders could be even lower than 2.5 million if holiday sales aren’t strong enough.The Taiwanese publication blames sky-high prices for the low initial orders. The iPad Pro starts at $799 for 32GB version, which may not be sufficient for most business users. If you want to buy 128GB version, you have to shell out $949 for the slate only. Add the Pencil ($99) and Smart Keyboard ($169), and it goes above $1,200. Prices could be even higher outside the United States.Businesses are looking to cut costs. It’s unclear if they would pay for a heavily-priced tablet and its accessories. However, some argue that 2.5 million units in the last few weeks of the year are still a decent result for a niche product. The iPad Pro will also face stiff competition from Microsoft’s Surface Pro 4. Though the Cupertino company has not specified a release date, a separate report claims that the iPad Pro will hit the stores on November 19th.Apple blog iFun.de spotted the iPad Pro product page on German reseller Cyberport’s website. Though the product listing has since been taken down, it was selling 128GB, cellular-equipped iPad Pro for €1,229 ($1,359). The same model would cost $1,079 in the United States. However, the November 19 launch seems unlikely as it falls on a Thursday. Apple has historically launched its new products on a Tuesday or Friday.
