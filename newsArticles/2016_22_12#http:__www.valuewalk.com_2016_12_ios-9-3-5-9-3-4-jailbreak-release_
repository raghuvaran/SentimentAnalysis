Just a few days ago, we shared with you the news that a new exploit had been discovered in iOS 10.1.1 and that this could lead to the release of a working jailbreak quite soon. However, what about those who are still stuck on an older version of the firmware, possibly due to having used the PanGu iOS 9.3.3 jailbreak? Since it was made public in June, there have been no further solutions released, meaning that those who have it have been left behind.It’s unfortunate, but if you’re still using the 9.3.3 solution from the summer, you’re probably wondering if it’s worth upgrading to iOS 10, and who could blame you? After all, Apple’s latest firmware has brought with it many changes and new features, and the future looks bright.Fortunately, there are those who have the technical skills who are still working on a solution that could partially plug the gap until the iOS 10 jailbreak becomes public. Some may question why it’s worth the time and effort to do this, but the answer to that is to get new features, tweaks, and access to apps that require newer firmware.The good news is that just a few days ago, a group of people who call themselves the FriedAppleTeam posted a video on Twitter. This video claimed to show two iPhones being jailbroken on iOS 8.4.1 and 9.3.2. However, what is of more interest is that it also works for 9.3.4 and 9.3.5.Jailbreak 8.4.1/9.3.2 One app to rule them all! P.S. Sorry, there is no 9.3.4 in AU to show off pic.twitter.com/ySSPIza2mm— FriedAppleTeam (@FriedAppleTeam) December 18, 2016We realize that if you’re reading this and have already upgraded to iOS 10, then there’s no going back for you. Apple no longer digitally signs any version of iOS below 10, so you’re trapped. The good thing, however, is that if you’re running a pre-10 version of iOS, this jailbreak solution should work for you.We don’t know when it will be available, as the FriedAppleTeam has not said when it plans to release this tool publicly, and they have failed to publicly respond to questions about the jailbreak tool on Twitter. If we’re honest, this does leave an ominous taste in the mouth. After all, how many times have people popped up on Twitter promising a solution, only never to deliver? You don’t need us to answer this, do you?As for what their followers are saying, TheBeastFromNo responded with the following question: “@FriedAppleTeam Omg Are you kidding me? I can’t believe it. When will it come out? Send me the link if it is out. Is it for 32bit devices?”Is the jailbreak community dead? No, it certainly is not if you consider how many reports there have been of late about possible solutions. It only goes to show that the community is thriving and those who try to produce and fail only lead the way for those who try to succeed in providing a working jailbreak.Over the next few days, we will be monitoring the FriedAppleTeam and asking them about their tool. If we discover new information or hear back, you will know ASAP. In the meantime, if you have any questions about this or want to share an opinion, please do so using the comments section below.
