For months, there were consistent rumors that Apple was working on a 4-inch smartphone called ‘iPhone 6C.’ The device was reportedly aimed at Apple’s loyal customers who were dismayed when the company moved away from the 4-inch smartphones. However, the Cupertino-based tech giant has now dropped plans for the iPhone 6C, says Cowen & Co. analyst Timothy Arcuri.In a research note to investors, obtained by Business Insider, Arcuri said all the evidence of iPhone 6C has disappeared from the supply chain. Notably, Arcuri was one of the first to report that Apple was working on such a device for 2015. Why did Apple drop the idea of a smaller next-gen iPhone? Arcuri believes it could be because of the strong sales of iPhone 6.The analyst says Apple wouldn’t want to cannibalize the sales of price-reduced iPhone 6 by coming out with iPhone 6C. The current flagship models are expected to get a price cut when Apple refreshes its iPhone line later this year. Apple knows how well the current iPhone 6 is selling. If the company sensed a strong demand for smaller iPhone 6C, it would release the device.Timothy Arcuri’s latest report is in line with what very reliable KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in April. Kuo revealed that Apple was unlikely to launch a 4-inch smartphone in 2015, though it may introduce the iPhone 6C in 2016. Last month, reports surfaced that AU Optronics had won a contract from Apple to supply 4-inch display panels for an unannounced iPhone model set for 2016 release.In June, Jefferies analysts claimed that Apple was working on a low-cost metal iPhone 6C with a 4-inch screen to be released in 2016. However, Jefferies didn’t reveal whether the 4-inch device will have the same internal components as the iPhone 6.Apple shares rose 0.19% to $123.01 at 10:14 AM EDT on Tuesday.
