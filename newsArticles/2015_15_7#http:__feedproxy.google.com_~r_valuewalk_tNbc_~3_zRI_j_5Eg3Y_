Apple just launched a refreshed iPod lineup which includes a new iPod Touch with an A8 chip and 8MP iSight camera. The tech giant also offers a 128GB version of the media player and updated the iPod Nano and Shuffle. All three devices are available in new colors: gold, blue, and pink.Apple’s iPhone and iPod vice president, Greg Joswiak, elaborated, “iPod touch gives customers around the world access to Apple Music, the App Store and iOS, the world’s most advanced mobile operating system, starting at just £159.”The 16GB iPod Touch starts at $199, the 32GB version retails for $249, the 64GB version costs $299, and the 128GB version sells for $399.Last week, reports surfaced claiming Apple would unveil a new line of media players. The last time the Cupertino-based tech giant updated the MP3 device was in 2012, so it’s been a long time coming. Some questioned whether Apple would eventually discontinue the iPod lineup. Last year, Apple stopped making the Classic iPod, but CEO Tim Cook reported that the reason had nothing to do with poor sales but everything to do with a lack of mechanical parts.iPod sales are on a decline: Apple lost 55% of revenue from MP3 players in 2013. Sales for the iPod Classic also declined 52% year over year. The iPod only earns 2% of Apple’s overall income compared to other devices. One major reason for the decline in sales is that people are downloading music apps on their smartphones instead. Many people access their music collections on the cloud or stream from popular apps like Spotify or Pandora.Apple’s new iPod lineup coincides with the recent Apple Music launch. The streaming service was made to give rivals a run for their money, but it also offers users more music for a monthly fee.
