Apple Inc. (AAPL) Innovation – Look At The ListI know I am a broken record regarding Apple’s policy of secret development followed by grand introductions  but I fear it has lead them to ignore small piecemeal upgrades.  I put the following in that category.Failure to routinely upgrade Apple TV Letting the MacPro die by not improving the data ports and not introducing a 5k external display Ditto on the data ports for the iMac Delaying 13 and 15 MacBook upgrades for too long Going years without introducing new wireless routers Letting Siri fall behind competing productsI’ll bet if you think for a while you can come up with other examples.  I can live with Apple working on secret products like a car for “grand introductions” if they feel they must.  But as a recurrent shareholder I cannot accept the slow process of basic innovation.  The company has too much talent to dwaddle like this.In response to my recent Apple posts I got a very thoughtful email from a reader.  It was so good that I thought it was worth sharing.I agree and would also add “improved cloud based products, icloud data/photo storage, Apple Music, etc” to the list.
