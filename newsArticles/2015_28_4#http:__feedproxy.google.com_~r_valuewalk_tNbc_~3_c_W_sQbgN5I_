Mega-cap alpha… Apple had an astonishing first quarter. It hit the $700 billion market cap milestone, and its stock made a 13% run. But can that be the new norm?Generating meaningful returns among mega-cap stocks is easier said than done. In fact, some managers don’t think it’s possible.A recent Morgan Stanley report contends that generating meaningful alpha investing in mega-cap companies – defined as those valued at $100 billion or more – can be done, though it’s not always easy.“For a long time, hedge funds had an anti-mega-cap bias, underweighting these names in favor of stocks less than $100 billion in market capitalization. Is that smart?” the report says. “The facts show that this $100 billion club is one where historically a sizeable amount of alpha can be generated…”Morgan Stanley analysts looked at 44 stocks listed in the U.S. with a market capitalization of $100 billion or higher to identify the potential for alpha among mega-cap stocks today.So on which mega-caps will you get the biggest bang for your buck? Morgan Stanley’s methodology identifies five with the highest potential for alpha over the next few years:Bank of America ranks alongside IBM, Gilead Sciences, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Apple as those forecast with the highest long-term growth among mega-caps, relative to what is currently priced.But lately, Bank of America hasn’t exactly been hitting home runs. Through market close Monday, BAC’s share price has declined 13% year-to-date. The company reported its first quarter numbers to mixed reactions on April 15th. Its net income for the quarter $3.4 billion ($0.27 per share), and its revenue was $21.4 billion, down $1.3 billion from the same period the year before. The firm may be up for a fight at its upcoming shareholders meeting as well, as proxy advisers ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against voting for some of its directors.Mega-cap alpha – Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) Gilead takes the cake for alpha-generating mega-cap potential in Morgan Stanley’s “quantmental” approach, which combines the output from its three-month alpha model (MOST) and 24-month relative return model (BEST) as well as the bull/bear ratio on the stocks from its fundamental analyst. Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Microsoft and Oracle round out the top five in the category.Gilead Sciences is up 9% in 2015 and nearly 40% over the past year, and analysts still like it. Needham recently reiterated buy rating on the stock, and Morgan Stanley reissued the same rating as well. In February, the company announced a $0.43 dividend, starting in the second quarter of the year, as well as a $15 billion buyback.In its analysis, Morgan Stanley utilized five factors to determine the best 36-month relative performance among mega-cap stocks: share buybacks, price-to-forward earnings, return on equity, total yield (dividend plus repurchase yield) and nine-month momentum. The findings: Amazon and Facebook look expensive, and IBM looks great. “IBM’s valuation is enough to offset its weak momentum to make it screen attractively,” the report says.It’s no secret IBM has been having a hard time lately. It managed to beat Wall Street estimates on first quarter earnings; however, a strong dollar took a toll on earnings. “In the first quarter we had a strong start to the year,” said Ginni Rommety, IBM CEO, in a statement. “Our strategic imperatives growth rate accelerated, demonstrating the power of our offerings in these new opportunities and contributing to improved revenue performance. Our focus on higher value through portfolio transformation and investment in key areas of the business drove continued market expansion.”The market hasn’t hated IBM, either. The stock has climbed more than 6% year-to-date.Mega-cap alpha – JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM)Morgan Stanley analysts are largely in line with the consensus view on three-year EPS growth for JPMorgan Chase. They are far above the consensus view on Amazon, however, and well below it on Exxon.JPM delivered strong first quarter results on the 14th of April, including a 12% rise in profits from the year before. Some of its big businesses rebounded, including its trading desks. Revenue at its bond-trading operations increased 61% from the previous quarter.Mega-cap alpha – Citigroup (NYSE:C)Ranked by forecasted total returns through 2019 based on price appreciation and dividend yield, Citigroup is among the most promising mega-caps when utilizing the latest P/E ratio (as of March).The stock has remained somewhat flat in 2015, its price declining about 2% year-to-date. It has, however, gained 10% over the past year. But it is corporate governance has put Citigroup in the headlines recently. This week, shareholders will vote on a proposal requiring the company disclose more information about its practice of paying executives who exit to take government jobs.With all criteria combined, Morgan Stanley makes the case that Bank of America, Gilead Sciences, IBM, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup are the best mega-cap bets for generating alpha. It ranks Exxon Mobile (NYSE:XOM), Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY), UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) as the worst.
