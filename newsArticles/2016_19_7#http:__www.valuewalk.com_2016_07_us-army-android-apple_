According to the latest reports, Apple and its iPhone have received a huge vote of confidence from the United States Army.The U.S. Army Special Operations Command is set to go about “dumping its Android tactical smartphone” in favor of the iPhone 6s. The implications are that the U.S. Army trusts the Apple smartphone to handle the demands of operational environments, and it will now be the selected device for use in the Tactical Assault Kit.At this stage the move has not been officially confirmed, however Morris cites a source who is less than pleased with the performance of the existing Android device. The unit currently in use is thought to be a modified version of the Samsung Galaxy Note, but it has left Special Operations Command unsatisfied to say the least.“When trying to run a split screen showing the route and UAS feed, the Android smart phone will freeze up and fail to refresh properly and often have to be restarted, a process that wastes valuable minutes,”said the source. “It’s seamless on the iPhone. The graphics are clear, unbelievable.”The source also said that Android units have been proven to freeze at crucial moments. In contrast the iPhone has been faster and smoother in high pressure situations, and the split screen scenario mentioned above is a great example of where the iPhone could be of benefit over the Android device for the U.S. Army.Google will undoubtedly be disappointed by the reported decision. However the U.S. Army needs to be able to rely on its device of choice in life and death situations, and the iPhone has apparently proven to be more reliable.Apple has a good track record in providing devices to the U.S. armed forces. In 2010 the Army started giving iPod Touches loaded with language modules to soldiers deployed in countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan.It is not clear which Android device the Army have been using up until now. If it turns out to be the original Galaxy Note, which was released in 2010, then it stands to reason that the iPhone 6s would perform better.The existing flagship Apple smartphone is far more technologically advanced than the 2010 Note, as you would expect. We are still waiting on official confirmation of the move from the U.S. Army. However if it does finally go ahead it is likely that the armed forces will collaborate closely with Apple in order to ensure that the rollout goes as smoothly as possible.Apple is currently preparing for the launch of its next generation flagship smartphone, the iPhone 7. The new model is expected to be unveiled in September, with a number of new features including a dual-lens camera and USB Type-C connectivity replacing the 3.5mm headphone jack.While consumers and investors look forward to the release of the iPhone 7 the U.S. Army is apparently not interested in waiting on the next generation phone. The existing iPhone 6s presumably has enough processing power and features to handle the tasks which the Army will throw at it.Rumor has it that the iPhone 7 will not bring any major changes, with Apple planning a major redesign for the 2017 edition which may be known as the iPhone 8. A vote of confidence from the U.S. Army will certainly do no harm to Apple’s marketing campaigns.
