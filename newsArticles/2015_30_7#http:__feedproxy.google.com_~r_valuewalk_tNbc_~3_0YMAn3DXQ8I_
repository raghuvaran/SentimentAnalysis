Apple’s Campus 2, popularly known as “Spaceship,” will apparently include a rooftop observation deck overlooking the core building, a café and a 10,114 square-foot store, which will be open for visitors to “view and purchase the newest Apple products.”Documents submitted in April revealed Apple’s intention of including a new visitor’s center, and now a new set of documents uncovered by the Silicon Valley Business Journal provide details on the interior of the building. According to the building plans, a visitor center is being developed to “create a public face of the Apple Campus 2 that reflects Apple’s business and design practices, and allows for a long-term presence in Cupertino.”Apple’s new visitor center will be a super-modern glass-walled structure with a carbon fiber roof featuring huge skylights. Apart from the store offering visitors an option to view and purchase Apple’s latest products, a 2,386-square-foot café is also being built. Visitors can reach the viewing deck via stairs and elevators, from which the ring-shaped building which houses Apple employees will be visible. According to the document, the visitor’s center will be at 10700 n.Tantau and will be open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Friday and 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. on the weekends.Apple’s current campus is comprised of a now-closed store where Apple-branded apparel and sundries were sold, but the addition of a visitor center with a dedicated store selling Apple products is an interesting concept. Once finished, Apple’s “Spaceship” campus will include a 2.8 million square-foot ring-shaped main building, a 100,000 square-foot fitness center, an underground parking lot, a 120,000 square-foot auditorium, and a visitor’s center.Apple is planning to finish the construction work for the main building by the end of 2016. Video footage shot in June showed that the foundation work had been done, and now the work is in process for the walls of the ring-shaped structure. Even the work for the nearby underground parking facility is almost done.
