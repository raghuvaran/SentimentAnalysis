Apple is very dependent on its iPhone business for a good rating on Wall Street. The firm generates 60% of its sales from the smartphone division. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) management is worried that sales of the iPhone are not growing and therefore has come up with a new strategy of widening the technology gap between the iPhone and iPad.On Wednesday, Apple Insider suggested that the company does not have any plans to bring its latest signature feature 3D Touch to its range of tablets for one year at least. The iPhone is a premiere device in Apple’s portfolio by a wide margin, and therefore, it makes complete sense that the company keeps it ahead of the tablet as far as features are concerned.According to Mikey Campbell of Apple Insider, the iPhone firm is facing certain scaling issues because of which it is not able to make the current 3D Touch tech work on larger displays such as on those on the iPad. The tech will take some time before it can come to the firm’s line of tablets though. The website learned from a source that Apple has already begun working on similar tech for larger screens.Trusted Apple analyst Ming Chi Kuo, citing supply chain movements, informed investors earlier this week that production issues are blocking 3D Touch from coming to the iPad Air 3 and not tech issues. Kuo believes that the parts needed for 3D Touch are “one of the most severe production bottlenecks in iPhone 6s supply chain.”And owing to such issues the firm is unable to put 3D Touch on the iPad Air, but it is still planning to release the device sometime in the first half of 2016. Kuo informed investors that the company plans to release the iPhone 7 in September 2016, and it is confirmed that the device will have 3D Touch on board. So it can be said that the smartphone is a priority for the firm and is a major barrier in the development of the iPad right now.On Wednesday, Apple stock closed up 0.77% at $111.34. Year to date, the stock is up by almost 1%, while in the last one month, it is down by over 2%.
