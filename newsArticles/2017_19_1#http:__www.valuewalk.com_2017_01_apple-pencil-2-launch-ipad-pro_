There have been numerous leaks and rumors about the upcoming iPhones and iPads. But this is probably the first time in months that the second-generation Apple Pencil has appeared in the rumor mill. According to a report from Asian publicationÂ Letem Svetem Applem, Apple is planning to introduce the Apple Pencil 2 along with new iPad Pro models this spring.The first Pencil was introduced in 2015 with the 12.9-inch iPad Pro. Apple later added support for the 9.7-inch iPad Pro as well. The first-gen Pencil is based on pressure sensitivity, meaning you need to press harder to draw thicker lines. Features of the upcoming Pencil are not fully known, but a Bloomberg report claimed in August last year that Apple was considering iPad capabilities that would allow the Pencil to work with a wide variety of apps.Rumors suggest that the new Apple Pencil will have a magnet system that will allow the accessory to attach to the iPad Pro. Apple has filed patent applications in the past for a Pencil with a built-in magnet system that would attach to an iPad when not in use. The Asian publication indicates that the Apple Pencil 2 could include a standard open clip so that it can be carried around without much difficulty.The report should be taken with a pinch of salt. But Apple is planning to bring major changes to its iPad Pro lineup. So, it makes sense for the company to launch an improved pencil accessory, especially considering the original Apple Pencil is more than a year old. Users of the original Pencil have complained about the lack of customization including no eraser. The upcoming model could address these issues.Other improvements could include enhanced accuracy and responsiveness. The Apple Pencil 2 is expected to be priced at $99, which is what the original Pencil costs. We should expect Apple to cut the price of the first-gen Apple Pencil when its successor comes out.KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes that Apple could introduce as many as three new iPad Pro models this spring. There will be a new 12.9-inch model and another with screen size between 10-inch and 10.5-inch. Both of them are expected to ship with the A10X processor. The third variant is said to have a 9.7-inch display and A9 processor. The Touch ID fingerprint sensor is expected to be embedded in the display of the new iPads.
