Apple fans are not going to like this. An Android bot urinating on Apple logo as been discovered on Google Maps. A small patch of terrain in Google Maps near the Pakistani city of Rawalpindi contains this bizarre image. The real terrain has no resemblance to the image. It was first spotted by Team Android, and can be seen only on Maps view. It disappears when you switch to Earth (satellite) view.The image was apparently added via Google Map Maker, which allows users to contribute to the map by adding details such as parks, places of interest, and street names. The information users add via Google Map Maker is moderated. But, in this case, something ridiculous seems to have slipped through the search engine giant’s system.And then there is another image just a few miles to the east of Android bot in the in the Takht Pari forest. It apparently tells the Mountain View-based company what the creator of this photo thinks about Google’s edit moderation policy. In simple language, it says that Google’s edit moderation needs some work. Anyway, it was a refreshing change for those tired of all the Apple Watch news today.According to The Guardian, the first image was added by an end-user “suggesting” some edit. Google said it had “terminated the Android figure involved in the incident.” A Google spokesman told Mashable that it was the result of a user “abusing” the Map Maker tool. He said all the edits are moderated, but sometimes a cheeky or inaccurate edit might slip through its system.The search engine behemoth is well known to drop some pranks and Easter eggs in Maps. But a recent Google Maps hack showed whistleblower Edward Snowden inside the White House. The company had promptly removed it.Have you discovered anything similar hidden in Google Maps?
