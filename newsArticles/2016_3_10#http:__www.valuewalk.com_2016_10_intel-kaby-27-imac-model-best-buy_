Intel has already been confirmed to be inside some iPhone 7 models, and now it’s been found in another Apple product. Best Buy’s website is showing what appears to be a 27-inch 5K iMac with a seventh-gen Kaby Lake Intel Core processor. However, there are some discrepancies that cast some doubt on the listing, reports Apple Insider. The line item for the new iMac popped up on the site on Sunday night.The Best Buy page claims that the product, which carries a model number of K0SC0LL/A, has a 27-inch display, 32GB of memory, a 2TB fusion drive, a seventh-generation Intel Core i7 processor, and the AMD Radeon R9 M380 graphics chipset with 2GB of video RAM.The line item is priced at $3,200, but an existing model customized with a 2TB Fusion drive, a 4.0 GHz sixth-generation i7 processor, and 32GB of RAM can be built to order at Apple.com for $3,150, which is $50 less than the Best Buy price, notes Apple Insider. Given that the R9 M395 is available in the 5k iMac, the R9 M380 is a strange inclusion on the Best Buy page.In addition, it is unclear whether Kaby Lake quad-core processors that are suitable for a 27-inch Retina 5K iMac are currently shipping or not.  The Apple model number as listed by Best Buy is another discrepancy because “K0SC0LL/A” does not match the existing nomenclature of MK482, MK472, or MK462 prefacing a remaining two digits and finishing with a /A, says Apple Insider.The rumor mill has little to say about an iMac refresh, but adding Kaby Lake to the it simultaneously with the introduction of a MacBook Pro is possible because it has been a year since the last refresh.In other Intel news, the first legitimate benchmarks of the upcoming Kaby Lake-based Core i7-7700K processor are finally out, and they are quite impressive. The benchmark is Geekbench 4, and it showcases Intel’s new and improved 14nm+ architecture. It performs faster than others, and with this, the chip making giant has managed to push out a quite significant single-threaded performance increase, notes WccftechThe processor is the flagship SKU of the Core i7-7700K, the Kaby Lake lineup. It will be the highest-clocked Intel CPU to date, featuring eight threads and four cores, just like its predecessor. It is possible that we will see chips reaching as high as 4.7 Ghz with the liquid cooling solutions.
