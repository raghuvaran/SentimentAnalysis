Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) revealed yet another quarter of sales declines this week when it shared its earnings. The overwhelming success of its 6th generation iPhone has made it very difficult for the firm to outdo itself. Despite this, CEO Tim Cook is still excited about the next generation of his company’s handsets. According to him, future Apple gadgets will be big on augmented reality as well as artificial intelligence.One need only look at the extremely popular Pokemon GO to see augmented reality’s place in today’s culture. For smartphones , it is the next big step in social interaction. Even social networking giants like Facebook and Twitter are handling their own virtual reality endeavors. Their adoption of such features alone should translate well into the technology’s mass use on people’s handsets.Apple is well aware of this and believes that VR, along with its great artificial intelligence qualities, should make the brand and its devices an even greater hit among consumers.“We think there’s great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity,” Cook reports. The CEO assured that Apple Inc. is investing heavily into augmented reality products and has been doing so for a long time now.The announcement, however, is a bit unlike Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL) experts report. The U.S. technology giant doesn’t usually pounce on emerging technology trends until it has proven its worth. Although, virtual reality is far from experimental. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says that there are a few things of which we can be certain will be huge in the future. He lists virtual and augmented reality among them.The fact that Apple is investing in augmented reality products is hugely exciting. However, analysts say the company needs to share a bit more about how it plans to capitalize on the technology. A lot more insight is needed in order to console investors. Ridding them of a few worries regarding the firm’s slowing sales would spare Apple a lot of controversy.“[T]hey want the world to know that they are working on it, but they have nothing to show for it.” These are the sentiments of Bob O’Donnell, who is an analyst at TECHnalysis Research.Even if Apple has been investing in augmented and virtual reality, it is lagging behind the market in this regard. Samsung — its chief rival in the smartphones department — is already growing more popular for the VR capabilities instilled on its phones. Despite Cook’s reassuring words, talk poses little threat against the public VR displays made by other tech giants.Moving forward, it is hoped that the Cupertino tech firm will reveal more on how it plans to outdo its rivals with its VR endeavors. However, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock remains fairly strong despite investor doubts.
