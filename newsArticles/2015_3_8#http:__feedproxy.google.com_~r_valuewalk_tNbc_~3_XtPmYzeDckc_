Apple’s Siri could soon transform the way people use voicemail by transcribing voicemail messages into text and then relaying them to the user through text message. When a caller using iCloud Voicemail cannot take a phone call, Siri will answer the call instead, letting the message go to straight to the digital audio recorder. Such a service may render other voicemail services from mobile carriers obsolete.Business Insider first noted that Apple employees were testing out the service a few weeks ago.Although iCloud’s voicemail can relay information as to why the receiver can’t pick up and where they are, Siri’s voicemail service offers more. James Cook for Business Insider added, “Apple sends voice data to company servers, where Siri converts the words spoken into text. iCloud Voicemail will presumably function in the same way, sending the raw voicemails to Apple, and Siri will then transcribe them and make them available on your iPhone.”The purported solution would be a win for everyone. Most people like to send voicemails because it is easier to record a voice than it is to manually type messages, however, most prefer receiving text messages. And since older people prefer voicemail but young people don’t, the voice-to-text service would bridge the gap and appeal to both generations.Siri is the voice-activated personal assistant on iOS. It helps users stay in touch with contacts, stay organized, find out the latest in entertainment or sports, find local businesses, and more. Apple gave the service a more prominent role with the upcoming iOS 9. The Cupertino-based tech giant highlighted the service during this year’s Worldwide Developers Conference and claimed Siri will replace Spotlight. The updated service will answer more complex commands and offer app suggestions based on personalized usage patterns.
