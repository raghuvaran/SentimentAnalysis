The Apple car debate continues, this time with Steve Wozniak expressing interest in seeing the company he co-founded duke it out with Tesla Motors in the EV space. He also said he won’t be buying one of the most expensive Apple Watch models.Wozniak made the comments during an interview with Paul Smith of the Australian Financial Review. The Apple co-founder is known to be one of Tesla’s biggest fans, as he excitedly revealed some time ago that Tesla had delivered his Model S.Since receiving his Model S, Tesla has launched the P85D model, which has dual motors. Wozniak gave Tesla props for the car, calling it one of the best technological innovations he has ever purchased.He said it would be good for Apple to move into the car market because the company needs another segment that bears the potential for big sales, and the car industry could offer huge sales. Wozniak added that he’s not sure whether Apple is actually working on a car or if it is simply optimizing its CarPlay dashboard apps.However, he pointed out that Apple seems to have been “hiring a lot of people who could really build a vehicle.” That, plus the opportunities that exist in self-driving cars and other automotive technology, would make the car industry a good fit for Apple, he believes.Wozniak also said this week that he thinks the Apple Watch might not do very well, especially because it’s too expensive. He said he will buy one of the cheapest models because they are more about putting apps on the wrist rather than the prestige associated with buying one of the highest-end models or the “jewelry ones.”The Apple co-founder said he will be keeping an eye on sales of the smartwatch to decide whether it’s worth a permanent place on his wrist. He said he had tried Samsung’s Galaxy Gear and other smartwatches but that after the novelty was gone, he got rid of them.Another aspect of the Apple Watch Wozniak will be watching is app development. He said it is necessary for some app to come to the forefront and make the Apple Watch virtually a necessity. He has found Apple Pay to be useful and believes that with the Apple Watch, Apple Pay would work even better.
