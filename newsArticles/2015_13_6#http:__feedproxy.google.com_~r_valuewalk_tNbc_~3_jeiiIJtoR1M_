With 2015 well under way, there are still several exciting smartphones to be released before the year is out. Here is a summary of six of the best handsets still to be released during this calendar year.Project Ara is certainly not the most well-known name on this particular list, but it has been described in some quarters as an awe-inspiring handset. Project Ara will reportedly deliver something genuinely revolutionary, offering consumers a fully customizable interface which enables users to swap key components.Project Ara refers to its internal components as modules, and people who purchase an Ara smartphone are free to swap in and out cameras, batteries and processors as they see fit. This process will have no negative impact on the functioning of the smartphone, which will continue to operate as normal regardless of any parts which are either added or subtracted.A smartphone which truly delivers that which a consumer desires, Project Ara is being produced by the behemoth that is Google. The only downside to this exciting project is that it probably won’t receive a mainstream release in 2015, but it is however being tested in Puerto Rico later this year.The Samsung Galaxy Note 5 was one of the mobile highlights of 2014, and thus the sequel to this handset promises to be one of the outstanding devices of 2015. The Galaxy Note 4 is generally considered to be the standout phablet in the world, possibly even superior to the outstanding Apple iPhone 6 Plus.Samsung is known for cramming its mobile devices full of outstanding specifications, and considering that the Galaxy Note 4 was no exception to this rule, we can expect something truly outstanding when of the galaxy Note 5 hits the stores. A faster, more efficient all-in-one Exynos 7422 processor, which combines GPU, CPU and RAM in one chip, may be a highlight of this device. And there is also a strong suggestion from close to the Samsung supply chain that a curved screen model will be given much more prominence this time out.Fans of Samsung will be hoping that the resolution of the device is notched up to 4K, while wireless charging is also expected to be migrated from the Galaxy S6. There is no doubt that this will be one of the heavyweight devices of 2015.Speaking of heavyweight devices, a new iPhone always amply fits this description. Apple had a truly outstanding 2014, and after the initial successes of its Apple Watch, the consumer electronics giant will be looking to continue the extraordinary performance of its flagship smartphone.No-one is quite sure whether the iPhone released this year will be branded iPhone 6s or iPhone 7, but it is expected that Apple will include the Force Touch functionality which was introduced in the Apple Watch. Reports have also focused on the quality of the camera in the iPhone 7, with reports linking the device with a professional quality DSLR snapper, and even a unique periscope device. Perhaps it is too early for either of these predictions to come to fruition, but a 12-megapixel snapper with improved Nvidia capturing capabilities seems a certainty based on rumours and iOS 9 leaks.Sapphire glass could be included in this time out, and it is also possible that Apple will match the Samsung Galaxy Note range and produce a quad HD phablet and full HD smartphone. RAM is expected to be doubled, and there have also been rumours of a unique form of aluminum being included to mitigate against bending. This should be a significant improvement on what is the world’s most successful and iconic smartphone brand.The Moto X represents an impressive range of smartphones which have yet to really catch fire in the Western marketplace. News about the smartphone release has been relatively thin on the ground, but we do know that all-round improved specs are likely.One possible innovation in particular suggested by some sources is that there will be two models of this smartphone. Both are expected to feature quad HD displays, and the CMO of the company, Adrienna Hayes, has also taken to Twitter in order to laud the qualities of the camera in the device.Motorola manufactures some of the best Android handsets available, and this latest offering should be well worth perusing later this year.It would be remiss to complete this list without including a Windows Phone, and the most interesting release during 2015 will be the Lumia 940Xl. Microsoft is certainly looking for better results from its mobile phone division, and this could just be the device to deliver on that desire.The Lumia 940XL will feature a Snapdragon 810 processor, 3GB of RAM, a quad HD display and a 20-megapixel camera. These are pretty impressive specs in their own right, but the device is also reported to embrace USB-C support, native pen support, and offer compatibility with Windows 10 and the critically acclaimed Office 365 software.This package certainly looks to be an ambitious one, and if it comes together effectively than the Lumia 940Xl could offer a fantastic combination of hardware and software.Finally, this offering from Sony comes off the back of better news for the corporation. 2014 was not a hugely successful year for the iconic Japanese company, with Sony haemorrhaging money pretty rapidly, and blaming it squarely on its failing mobile phone products. But the success of the PlayStation 4 has emboldened the company somewhat, and the Xperia Z4 could benefit from this positive mood at Sony.Just to note, the Xperia Z4 is intended for Japan, while the Xperia Z3+ will be released in Europe and North America. Specifications have already been announced for the device, with a 5.2-inch full HD display, 20.1-megapixel rear camera, 5-megapixel front camera, Snapdragon 810 and 3GB of RAM all confirmed.Sony has manufactured some of the most iconic consumer electronics devices in history, and although this smartphone is unlikely to rank alongside its most notable achievements, it could be an interesting device to assess later this year.
