The PanGu iOS 9.3.3 jailbreak has been available for a few days now, and in most cases, it has proven to work without a problem for the first, second and maybe even a third time. However, there are some problems with the iOS 9.3.3 jailbreak and the process itself.The most common issues which seem to be affecting people who have installed the PanGu iOS 9.3.3 and below jailbreak are as follows: problems with Apple ID being recognized, the jailbreak failing from the start, Cydia crashing, and Facetime not working. Note that these are not in order of the most common or most severe.Also there are more being reported almost daily, so keep an eye out for other fix articles.As you would expect them to be, the PanGu team is working on a fix for all of the reported problems, so you would not be wrong if you just sat back and waited for them to release an update.If you’re thinking about wiping your iPhone and starting again, don’t rush into that decision before getting some help. The reason is because with the iOS 9.3.3 jailbreak, it is possible to completely restore your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch to stock iOS or even re-jailbreak it. Most people think you can only use a Windows-based PC to use this jailbreak. While the PanGu tool does recommend that you use one, you can use a Mac if you have a virtual machine installed on it. You can also install the jailbreak via the Safari browser.At any rate, let’s move onto this problem. If the PanGu jailbreak tool on your Windows computer will not open, there’s a good chance that you have opened and then closed it prior to attempting to get it to run again.If this is you, then you must restart your computer.

This should now allow you to open the PanGu tool.Depending on where you found the tutorial to jailbreak your iOS device, it should have warned you about the dangers of adding your one and only Apple ID in the PanGu tool. Personally, I have recommended to people that they create a second Apple ID and use that. Whether you did this or not, if the PanGu tool displays a crying computer after you entered your ID, there is a problem. As it stands, there are two possible solutions:1) Turn off two-factor authentication in your iCloud settings.2) Use the jailbreak method that does not require a PC to complete it; you can find a link to it above.If it’s become clear that you can’t complete the iOS 9.3.3 jailbreak and you’re seeing an error message in Chinese, you need to do the following:1) Restart your computer and iOS device; once restarted, make sure that Find My iPhone is switched off.2) Make sure that you are running the latest version of iOS 9.3.3. If you’re not, you should be.3) Make sure your passcode is turned off.4) If the above does not change your situation, you should restore your device and make sure that you don’t have any over-the-air updates waiting on your iPhone.If you have been having problems with location services since completing the iOS 9.3.3 update, don’t be overly worried as there are a few fixes for this problem.1) Go to Settings –> General –> Reset Network Settings.
