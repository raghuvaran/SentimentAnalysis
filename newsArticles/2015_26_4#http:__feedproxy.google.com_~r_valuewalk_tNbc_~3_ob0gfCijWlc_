With the Apple Watch having launched this week, consumers now have a decision to make about which model to purchase. But with the Apple Watch being so diverse in its nature, and Apple having produced so many different variants of the base smartwatch, this could prove to be a difficult decision. So here is a rundown on some of the many buying options that Apple Watch consumers now have available to them.Apple initially advertised the price of the Apple Watch as beginning at $349. And this was not an inaccurate indication, as the entry-level Apple Watch, featuring an aluminum case, Ion-X glass over the display and rubber-like fluoroelastomer band does indeed retail at $1 under 350. There is also a larger 42mm size of the device which will retail for $399 for the time being. This is certainly a good entry point for anyone wanting to purchase a smartwatch, and with five colors and two sizes to choose from, there are effectively 10 variants of the Apple Watch Sport.The competitive price point of the Apple Watch Sport has led to it attracting the most sales in the early days of the device according to analyst estimates. With a variety of colours available, including white, blue, green and pink, this is certainly a customizable smartwatch, and one that will appeal to youthful fans of Apple in particular.Alongside the Apple Watch Sport is a stainless steel Apple Watch, which features a fluoroelastomer Sport Band intended to make it particularly comfortable for gym usage. This is by no means as affordable as an Apple Watch Sport, though, with the pricetag for this addition of the Apple Watch being $549 for the 38mm size, and $599 for the 42mm variant. The slightly hefty pricetag is due to the fact that aluminum is replaced with stainless steel, while Apple has also added sapphire glass to the make-up of this smartwatch.This watch is less customizable than the Apple Watch Sport, but a pretty nifty device for any consumer wanting a combination between style and functionality.The next edition of the Apple Watch, which features a no-frills Classic Buckle, is slightly more expensive, weighing in at $649 for the smaller size, and $699 for the larger edition of the smartwatch. This is a black-only device, which will appeal to those that specifically engage with the design of this smartwatch. Another similar edition of the Apple Watch which is available from launch features a Milanese Loop, with a woven smooth stainless steel mesh and a magnetic, infinitely adjustable clasp.Another version of the Apple Watch is based around a leather loop. According to Apple, the leather in question has been milled in Italy, with the magnetic aspects of the smartwatch being hidden in the leather loop ends. This particular edition of the Apple Watch is only available in the larger 42mm watch size, and is retailing for $700 in the United States.What is worth noting about this model of the Apple Watch is that the more sizeable device has a longer battery life, so this could make this particular variant appeal to those that think the shorter battery life of the 38mm Apple Watch is an unattractive prospect. Colors consist of stone, light brown, bright blue and black.Another version of the Apple Watch features a top-grain leather band, and retails at $749. It is also noteworthy due to its two-piece magnetic closure, and the fact that it is only available in the 38mm stainless steel case. Colors are soft pink, brown, midnight blue and black, and one might expect this edition of the watch to appeal to those that want the most comfortably wearable device available.The all-metal Link Bracelet version of the Apple Watch is certainly an attractive variant of the smartwatch, and it is also priced extremely competitively. Compared to other similar watches which offer only timekeeping functionality, the Link Bracelet Apple Watch is fairly affordable at $949 for the 38mm variant and $999 for the 42mm version. The Link Bracelet in space gray black stainless steel version is slightly more expensive, with the retail price in the United States $50 more for both models of this device.Unquestionably, the Apple Watch Edition has received mored column inches than any other version of the Apple Watch. This is due to the eye-popping price tag attached to the device, which is clearly intended to compete with luxury watch manufacturers such as Rolex and Cartier.The limited-edition Apple Watch Edition is made of 18-karat gold, and comes in eight rather pricy variants. The most affordable for those wanting a bit of luxury at the best possible price are the 38mm Apple Watch Editions with a rose gold case and White Sport Band, and the yellow gold case with a Black Sport Band.Both of these models retail at $10,000 in the United States, with the 42mm equivalent costing $12,000. One might not unreasonably suggest that adding $2,000 for merely an extra 2mm is rather extortionate, but consumers attracted to the Apple Watch Edition will ultimately purchase the version of the watch that they most strongly covet.However, this is not the end of the story for the Apple Watch Edition. There is also a $15,000 price point variant that comes a 42mm yellow gold case with a Black Classic Buckle and 42mm yellow gold case with a Midnight Blue Classic Buckle. This particular edition does not feature a 38mm version.Finally is the most expensive version of the Apple Watch, the 18-karat rose gold case and rose gray modern buckle Apple Watch Edition, which will retail in the United States at $17,000. This is unquestionably the most extravagant smartwatch available on the market at present, and it will appeal to those who can be seduced by ostentatious bling.Apple has ultimately tried to cover all bases with the release of the Apple Watch, and although smartwatches do not appeal to all consumers, there is certainly something available for all tastes.
