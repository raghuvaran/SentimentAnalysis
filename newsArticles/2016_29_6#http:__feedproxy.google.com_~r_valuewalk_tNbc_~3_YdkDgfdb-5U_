Apple could bring relief to many comedians and artists who are annoyed with the repeated clicks of photos being taken during their performances. Now the tech giant thinks it has found a way to halt the practice.The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office awarded Apple a patent on Tuesday that would stop people from using their tablet or smartphone cameras to record videos and audio or snap pictures under certain conditions. The patent is highly technical.Apple’s idea is to create tech that would send infrared signals at cameras when people try to record a video or snap a photo. The signal would be programmed to disable any recording and photography for as long as the signal is on.“In some embodiments, a transmitter can be located in areas where capturing pictures and videos is prohibited (e.g., a concert or a classified facility) and the transmitters can generate infrared signals with encoded data that includes commands temporarily disabling recording functions,” the patent reads.In simple words, performers and concert organizers would be able to set up a device that keeps audience members from recording their favorite songs.Though people are generally asked to turn off their electronic devices when they are attending a concert or a comedy show, most just ignore the requests and record videos and snap photos throughout the show. On YouTube, you can even see many comedians calling out audience members who record their shows. The main issue is that photos and videos from performances are frequently uploaded to social networking sites. This upsets performers as it drops ticket sales and hurts music.Apple notes that this technology may have practical uses in sensitive locations as well where taking video and capturing images could be a security risk. For example, someone could sneak into a bank and record a video showing how it is secured. In addition, it is possible that foreign agents could infiltrate facilities to gather intelligence. This technology from Apple would prevent some of that.Like other tech companies, Apple files several patents, but many of Apple’s ideas are never commercialized. So we don’t know if this technology will ever make it to the market.On Tuesday, Apple shares closed up 1.68% at $93.59. Year to date, the stock is down almost 13%, while in the last year, it is down by over 26%.
