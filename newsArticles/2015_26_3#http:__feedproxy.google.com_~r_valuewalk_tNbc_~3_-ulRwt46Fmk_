Apple made another big purchase. The Cupertino-based tech giant acquired a London-based data analytics firm called Acunu, a real-time analytics platform. It also boasted high-velocity ingests.It was reported that the iPhone maker did an “acqi-hire” of Acunu’s most important employees about two years ago, although the actual time frame in which that happened is unknown. From the latter half of 2013 to early 2014, seven of Acunu’s employees transferred to Apple. This shift includes the company’s founding CEO, Tim Moreton. He now works as an iCloud Manager in San Francisco.Last year, chief product officer Andrew Byde started his job as senior software engineer. Unlike Moreton, he works at the London headquarters. Other notable Acunu employees include Richard Low, Sam Overton and Nicolas Favre-Felix. Overton works with distributed systems for Apple. His work also involves the development of available distributed systems for structure storage.In December, former Acunu employees joined the tech giant, one as an engineer for CloudKit Technology, and just last month, another as a kernel engineer for iCloud. The U.K.’s Executive Agency also listed Acunu’s address as 100 Bridge Street; the same address of Apple’s official registered address in Europe.Acunu’s roots started six years ago when it was founded by a group of researchers and engineers from British universities. The company’s website is no longer running. However, a cached snapshot of the former website shows a description of the site’s services. Tim Moreton opened up to Planet Cassandra magazine in 2013; he claimed his company worked for financial institutions to collect financial data from the market. He explained that it was to understand activities in trading environments. The list of his company’s duties included performing risk analysis and finding anomalies.Acunu also worked with telecommunication companies to help them parse data. Other tasks on the company’s to-do list included processing events into C* operations for incremental analytics.via: AppleInsider
