Apple’s first retail store in New York City’s Queens borough is set to open on Saturday. The highly-anticipated store will be the eighth Apple store in New York City. The Queens Center has already brought in significant amounts of traffic, and Apple’s new store is expected to bring in even more traffic. The company’s retail market director, Jason Barlia, expressed excitement about the store opening. He also added that the new location made a lot of sense.The new Apple Store has a total of 130 staff members who speak 25 different languages. Two-thirds of those staffers speak two languages. The store will be different from most of the other Apple Stores in the New York City area as it will be a typical mall store instead of the usual elaborate store design many would expect. The upcoming Queens store will feature a genius bar and personal setup services. The store also features over 140 devices on display for customers to test out before buying.The new opening comes just after Apple’s big store opening on the Upper East Side. Other Apple stores are scattered throughout the vicinity, including on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, Staten Island, the Upper West Side, and SoHo. Apple strives to expand its presence around the world, and building new retail stores is just one way to achieve that.In other Apple-related news, the Cupertino-based tech giant is rumored to be testing its largest tablet computer yet.
