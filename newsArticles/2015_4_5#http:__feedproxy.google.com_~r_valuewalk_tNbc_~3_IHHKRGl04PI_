Apple is reportedly working on a bigger iPad Pro, which will apparently feature a Bluetooth stylus, Force Touch, NFC and many more features, says a report from Apple Insider, which cites an unnamed source. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo was the first to tell the world about a bigger iPad Pro in the making. The source confirmed that for now, tap-to-pay functionality will most likely not be a part of the iPad, but NFC could become the route for the device to channel payments through Apple Pay. Additionally, an NFC feature could also make it easier to integrate accessories such as the new stylus. As per the report, a large size iPad will also have a new touchscreen with advanced touch and will further fuel performance once clubbed with an Apple-built Bluetooth stylus.According to Apple Insider’s source, the stylus will be paired with the device through Bluetooth and will also feature pressure-sensitive input. Apple is reportedly baking the sense pressure recognition feature into the new iPad and will be hoping to roll over its Force Touch input to the 12.9-inch iPad. The feature is available in MacBooks as for now, and there were reports that the iPhone 6S will also feature Force Touch input.Citing the source, the report says the iPad Pro will run on the next-generation A-series processor. The iPad Air 2 has an A8X processor, which is an advanced version of the A8 chip in the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.Apple’s larger iPad will probably come with a USB-C input feature, informed the source, without saying whether it will be a new second port option or if USB-C would take the place of the Lightning connector found on current iPads. Previously, some pictures surfaced showing spaces for the two-port opening, indicating that Apple could probably include both USB-C and Lightning connectors and can also offer docking features in two different orientations.As of now, there is no official information on the new iPad, but it is believed that the gadget will debut at some point this fall.
