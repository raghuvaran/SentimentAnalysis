Apple’s iPhone 7 came out a while ago, but there might not be a more suitable time to purchase the smartphone than Friday. It’s the day after Thanksgiving, Black Friday. This means that customers and Apple fans can purchase the device for a little lower price.Even though, the iPhone 7 handsets are likely to be expensive, deals at certain retailers might interest you. For example, at Wal-Mart, any buyer who signs up for a contract with AT&T or Verizon is awarded a $250 gift card to the store. A deal from Target appears to be quite similar. Sam’s Club is also offering a similar deal as well, notes IB Times. However, it must be noted that those plans may prove to be quite expensive.
