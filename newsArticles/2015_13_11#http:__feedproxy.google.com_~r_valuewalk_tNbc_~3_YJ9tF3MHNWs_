Apple will officially shut down Beats Music on Nov. 30. The music curation and playlist generation technology of Beats Music has already been infused into Apple Music. The shutdown announcement was made on the Beats Music support page by Customer Experience Manager Dale Bagwell.Bagwell noted that at the termination of the service on Nov. 30, all subscriptions to the service will be cancelled. It is recommended that all current service users transfer their profile and picks and preferences to Apple Music.“All the pros that curated music for you are still crafting more amazing experiences. Plus, on Apple Music, you’ll get even better recommendations based on music you already listen to and love,” Bagwell writes, adding that users will be able to enjoy 24/7 global radio with Beats 1.Talking about Apple’s music service, Bagwell said customers can subscribe to the three-month test drive of the streaming service if they have not done so until now. Apple’s music service offers its subscribers musical recommendations, and for this, it uses purchases they made from Apple’s iTunes Store and songs they rip from CDs or choose on demand from a catalog that has more than 30 million titles.Apple, which purchased Beats for $3 billion last year, not only acquired its hardware and software units but also its high-profile executives — Jimmy Iovine, Dr. Dre and Trent Reznor. Beats Music’s service was a minor player in the streaming music industry when Apple folded its curation and playlist generation technology into Apple Music.Apple Music and Beats 1 Radio both made their debut together in June. In October, the company said the service had 6.5 million paying members. Apple Music was an iOS exclusive at that time, but later it was ported over to the fourth-generation Apple TV vis tvOS. And this week the company launched a beta version of its Apple Music Android app also.Apple resisted adopting a music subscription model for several years, and the introduction of the music service marks a radical departure from the norm. The iPhone maker with its music service intends to extend itself into more facets of consumers’ lives.
