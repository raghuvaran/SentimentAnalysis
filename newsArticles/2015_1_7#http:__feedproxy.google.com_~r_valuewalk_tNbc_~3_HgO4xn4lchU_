Apple just updated its much-forgotten iPod lineup with new colors. The Cupertino-based tech giant has apparently leaked some new colors through the latest version of iTunes, 12.2. There are three new iPod colors: hot pink, gold and deep blue. To see the three new colors, you have to connect your current iPod to iTunes 12.2 running on a PC or Mac.From the images, the new iPod Touch doesn’t appear to feature the Touch ID fingerprint sensor button, and it’s expected to keep the 4-inch screen. The iPod lineup already offered devices in similar colors, but the new hues add something fresh and fun. The current iPod Touch lineup comes in your choice of six colors: (PRODUCT)RED, yellow, space gray, silver, pink and blue. The iPod Nano and Shuffle come in eight colors, including green and purple in addition to the six previously listed colors.The last time Apple updated the iPod lineup was in 2012, so it has been a long time coming. Given Apple’s history of recycling older features from previous iPhones to cut iPod Touch costs, it is likely the new media player will feature a more powerful chip.The updated iPod preview comes just one day after Apple launched its music streaming service. Apple Music is the tech giant’s answer to popular streaming services like Pandora and Spotify. The new service offers on-demand music streaming and a live radio station. It also works with iTunes, which means all the songs you previously purchased and will purchase in the future are integrated with songs you just want to stream.Apple hopes to be the number one source for all things music, which is why the tech giant also features Connect, a social outlet that lets users connect with their favorite artists. The service starts at $9.99 for individuals and $14.99 for family plans. The service is still very new, so it will take a while to see how it fairs against competing streaming music services.Source
