Apple is one tech company that puts a lot of effort into charitable programs, making it one of the most notable Silicon Valley companies in this respect. The iPhone maker’s latest effort involves preserving the environment in China.Apple CEO Tim Cook recently published his first post ever on Weibo in English and Chinese. His note said he is happy to be back in Beijing and that he is ready to announce exciting new environmental programs. Within the first three hours of his post, Cook had an impressive 301,628 followers–all without following others or posting other things on Weibo.His first post involves the announcement of Apple’s partnership with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) to protect 1 million acres of forest in China. The forests provide fiber for paper and wood products. Apple’s move means its business activities will have zero impact on the world’s trees and power operations by using renewable energy. Lisa Jackson, former lead of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Apple’s current vice president of Environmental Initiatives, explained that forests are renewable energy resources.She believes they can run on natural renewable resources and protect sustainable working forests as needed to produce product packaging. The new announcement comes three weeks after Apple first introduced its major solar project. Apple claimed 87% of its global operations ran on renewable energy. The new Sichuan Province solar project will bring the Cupertino-based tech giant closer to 100%.Cook explained that it will probably take years to reach this goal but added that it is important Apple takes the initiative to reach that goal. Apple’s solar installations come as part of a partnership with SunPower Corp and other Chinese companies. It should generate enough power for up to 61,000 homes, a number that’s more than enough for supplying Apple’s offices and stores in China.
