At its annual hardware event one year ago, Alphabet unveiled new gadgets that were similar to what Apple had revealed earlier that year, but at lower prices. This time it launched two products that Apple hasn’t launched yet, and at prices far lower than what the iPhone maker is typically known for, according to MarketWatch‘s Jennifer Booton.On Tuesday, Alphabet’s Google launched two new smartphones, the Pixel and Pixel XL, with which it will compete with Samsung’s Galaxy line and Apple’s iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. The company has set the prices on par with rivals, with $649 being the starting price.More importantly, Google unveiled a new mobile virtual reality headset called Daydream View to compete with Samsung’s Gear VR and also an Amazon Echo rival and home assistant speaker called Google Home. The prices of the headset and speaker are much lower than those of existing market leaders, notes the report.In September, Apple unveiled the new iPhones and a host of upgrades as well, but it did not launch a home automation hub similar to the Echo and Home. Also it did not launch a virtual reality-related product that would compete with Daydream or Gear VR.Apple has a virtual reality game plan in place, most analysts believe. Though Apple has been late to the home automation hardware market, it is boosting its capabilities through Siri and its Home app to be able to compete with rival devices down the road.Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research, said, “Although it’s tempting to look at Echo and Home as part of a new intelligent home speaker market, what they really are is new endpoints for the existing smart assistant market, and Apple has a play there: Siri.”Apple may have plans for virtual reality and home automation, but a fact that can’t be denied is that it will have to play catch-up to Google and other players when it enters these segments.Along with competing with Apple, Google is following in its footsteps and has decided to work exclusively with a single carrier in the United States. The search giant has signed Verizon for the Pixel, emulating Apple’s agreement to launch the original iPhone with AT&T, notes Reuters.Analysts believe that Google’s Pixel, which will be available in two sizes, will have its high-end camera as one of the few distinguishing features. The device will be available in black, blue and silver and take just 15 minutes to charge for up to seven hours of battery life. Pre-orders begin on Tuesday.
