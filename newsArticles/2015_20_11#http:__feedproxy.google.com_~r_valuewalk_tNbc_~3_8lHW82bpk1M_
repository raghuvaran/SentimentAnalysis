Overall, the Health Care and Consumer Staples sectors were the most popular among the 50 biggest hedge funds during the quarter.The folks at FactSet analyzed data from the top 50 hedge funds’ 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, while S&P Capital IQ analysts looked at the top ten funds for their analysis earlier this week.According to FactSet Research Analyst Andrew Birstingl, the top 50 hedge funds upped their exposure to stocks by 7.6% during the third quarter.

The fund purchased, in total $2.1 billion worth of Baxter shares during the quarter, with Dan Loeb’s Third Point being one of the biggest purchasers. The firm added $1.3 billion to its preexisting position during the quarter. JANA Partners also purchased a significant amount of Baxter stock, establishing a 2.3% stake worth more than $400 million.In second place was Allergan, with the 50 biggest hedge funds buying a total of $1.7 billion worth of the Botox maker’s stock. Discovery Capital led the way in Allergan purchases with $290 Million, while Visium Asset Management added $270 million in Allergan stock to its holdings.Birstingl also found that Allergan was not only the top holding of the 50 biggest hedge funds but also the second most widely held, trailing only Time Warner Cable. In aggregate, Allergan was 1.4% of hedge fund portfolios. As of the end of the third quarter, 28 of the funds owned shares of Allergan, and three of the funds had the drug company as their biggest holding.The bet didn’t pay off for these funds, however, as Allergan shares fell 11.4% during the quarter.Looking at all of the sectors, PayPal (which was only recently spun off from eBay, making it a newly available stock during the quarter), racked up the most purchases among the top 50 hedge funds with $3.2 billion worth of shares being added to the aggregate portfolio. Carl Icahn’s fund Icahn Associates Holdings led the way with a 3.8% stake worth $1.4 billion.Interestingly, Icahn unloaded all of his stake in former parent company eBay during the quarter, dumping 46.3 million shares worth $1.7 billion into the market. The activist investor’s dumping of eBay stock was part of a larger trend among the biggest hedge funds, however, as eBay was the third largest aggregate sale during the quarter.Amazon was the second biggest overall purchase during the quarter with the biggest hedge funds grabbing up $3.2 billion worth of the online retailer’s shares. Tiger Global Management led the way, adding $1.3 billion worth of Amazon shares to its holdings.

Highfields Capital Management sold $716 million worth of shares, while Pentwater Capital Management dumped $732 million in shares and D.E. Shaw Group sold $453 million in AT&T stock.

In aggregate, the iPhone maker racked up $1.2 billion in sales, with Discovery Capital, Citadel Advisors, and Shaw leading the way in sales. The selloff in Apple shares sent the stock down 12.9% during the third quarter, although Carl Icahn maintained his 52.8 million share position in it, which keeps him one of the company’s biggest shareholders.Birstingl also reports that as of the end of the quarter, the top 50 hedge funds’ biggest exposure sector-wise was Consumer Discretionary with 17.7% of the aggregate portfolio being allotted to the sector. This observation was the same as the second quarter, although during the third quarter, the sector became the biggest weighted sector, unseating Information Technology.On a quarter over quarter basis, the sector with the biggest increase in exposure was the Consumer Staples sector, which saw a 1.1 percentage point increase. The biggest decline was in Energy, which lost 1 percentage point in exposure.On a relative basis versus the GICS sector weights of the S&P 500, the aggregate hedge fund portfolio was overweight in five sectors and underweight in five sectors,” the analyst added.
