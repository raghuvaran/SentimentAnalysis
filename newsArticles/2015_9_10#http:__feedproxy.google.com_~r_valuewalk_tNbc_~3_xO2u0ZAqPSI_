Apple has confirmed battery discrepancies in the new iPhone models, saying that manufacturing differences are causing every device to perform differently. However, Apple says the difference in performance is minimal, and in some of the devices, the battery performance could be 3% better in real-world conditions owing to standard tolerances.Apple’s statement refutes claims by online testing groups that reported up to a 50-minute gap between two different devices (a sample size that is too small). The differences in the battery performance could be due to the fact that demand for the devices was too huge, and in order to meet it, Apple made use of a second chip maker, TSMC, alongside Samsung, testers said.“Our testing and customer data show the actual battery life of the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus, even taking into account variable component differences, vary within just 2 to 3 percent of each other,” Apple said in a statement to TechCrunch.Refuting the third-party tests in the lab, Apple referred to them as :manufactured” because of the use of unrealistic parameters. The iPhone firm said the tests do not represent real-world usage as they “spend an unrealistic amount of time at the highest CPU performance state,” and this, according to Apple, is misleading.Apple also clarified that the difference in the battery life is typical for both current and past Apple products, and it reflects across all types of phones. Therefore, the company claims it bears no relation to the company making the A9 chip. Apple said each and every chip used in the iPhone meets its highest standards for ensuring great performance and good battery life.Mainstream gadget reviews barely cited the battery performance of the new iPhone, with many seeing the performance similar to the model released last year. Apple believes maintaining battery life year after year is an engineering feat, as it has been increasing performance with the new A9 chip and has doubled the built-in device memory in the case of the iPhone 6S. However, consumers are still very much considerate about the battery life of the devices.Despite the performance differences, analysts are bullish on the A9 chip. Timothy Arcuri of Cowen and Company believes the A9 puts Apple in a strong position going into the A10.
