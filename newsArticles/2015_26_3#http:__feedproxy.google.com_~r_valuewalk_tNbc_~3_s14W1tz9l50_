Now that Apple has revealed the much-anticipated Apple Watch, the iPhone 6S and much-rumored iPad Pro are the most anticipated Apple devices coming this year. The iPad Pro rumors have been buzzing around for more than two years, and the device is finally expected to hit the stores this year. Following the success of the big-screen iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, consumers are looking forward to their successor.There have been plenty of rumors about the iPhone 6S. IHS Technology director Kevin King has learned from supply chain sources in China that mass production of the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus is set to begin in June. The iPhone maker has asked its manufacturing partners to produce 230 million units of the new phones in the first 12 months.The iPhone 6S is expected to retain the same form factor as its predecessor. But recent reports indicate that the next iPhone will also be available in rose gold alongside the usual gold, silver and space gray. The device will have 2GB RAM and Samsung-made A9 processor. The iPhone 6S will run the upcoming iOS 9 operating system, which is being publicly tested. The new OS will focus more on stability and bug-free experience instead of introducing new features.A new report from DigiTimes claims that Apple will release three iPhones this year. The company is working on a 4-inch iPhone, along with the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus. DigiTimesâ€™ sources said the 4-inch iPhone will be manufactured by Wistron while Foxconn will be responsible for the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus. The third iPhone is aimed at offering more choices to consumers.The 12.9-inch iPad Pro is another highly anticipated device. Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that Apple had to push back the launch of the new iPad because of the supply issues with its 12.9-inch display. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes that it will be launched in the second half of this year. The yet-to-be-announced device is expected to feature A9 processor, iOS 9 operating system and 2GB RAM.It would be interesting to see if the iPad Pro can revive the falling iPad sales.
