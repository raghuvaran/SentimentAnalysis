Apple Watch has already hit the stores. Now Apple fans are excited about what the Cupertino company has in store next. With the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) approaching, we can be sure that the iPhone maker will unveil its new software for mobile devices and Macs at the event.

So, what should you expect from Apple in 2015?The Cupertino company is expected to launch the iPhone 7 in September this year. Earlier, there were rumors that Apple would release an iPhone 6S. But KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said last month that Apple will jump directly to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. He argued that the new smartphone will feature the Force Touch technology, which is too big a feature for a minor upgrade like an iPhone 6S. The ‘S’ versions usually bring minor upgrades.The iPhone 7 is rumored to be built using the super strong Series 7000 aluminum alloy that is 60% more rigid than the material used in the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. Despite its strength, the new alloy weighs only a third as much as stainless steel. Among other things, the iPhone 7 is expected to run Samsung-made A9 processor, 2GB RAM, and iOS 9 software. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will retain the display size of their predecessors, Kuo said.Apple will once again try to establish its hold in the music industry.
