About two weeks after releasing the first beta of iOS 10.3 to developers, Apple has seeded the second beta of iOS 10.3, watchOS 3.2 and tvOS 10.2. If you are a registered developer, you can download the beta 2 over the air or from the Apple Developer Center. The second beta build numbers are 14E5239e for iOS 10.3, 14V52114d for watchOS 3.2, and 14W5231d for tvOS 10.2.Apple has also released the Xcode 8.3 beta 2 with Swift 3, reports MacRumors. The iOS 10.3 is said to be the last major update to Apple’s mobile operating system before the iOS 11 is unveiled. It brings several new features and improvements. One of the biggest highlights of 10.3 is the Find My AirPods feature within the Find My iPhone app, which lets you locate the lost AirPods.Find My AirPods keeps a record of the last known location of the earphone when it was connected to an iOS device. It also causes the lost AirPod to produce a loud sound. With the iOS 10.3, Apple is moving from the older HFS+ file system to an Apple File System (APFS). The new file system includes strong encryption and is optimized for flash/SSD storage.The 10.3 beta also brings WiFi calling for Verizon customers for iCloud-connected devices. On the App Store front, Apple will allow developers to respond to customer reviews. Users will also be able to label reviews as “Helpful” or “Not Helpful.” The Cupertino company would allow customers to leave app reviews without exiting the respective app. If you don’t want to receive the app review request prompts, you can turn them off for all apps using a “master switch.”Other features include a 32-bit app alert warning users that future versions of iOS would only support 64-bit apps. In the second beta of iOS 10.3, Apple has added a “Learn More” button with the alert, but the button simply redirects you to the Settings app. The company is expected to update it in future beta versions. The latest beta also brings WiFi calling for British carrier Three to iOS 10.3.The watchOS 3.2 includes a new Theater Mode that allows you to quickly mute the alerts and avoid waking the screen on wrist raise. You’ll still get notifications, including haptics, while in Theater Mode. If you want to view them, simply press the Digital Crown or tap the screen. This feature is particularly useful in movie theaters where notifications  and wrist raise could distract people around you.Apple has also reorganized the Control Center toggles. The watchOS 3.2 beta brings SiriKit to the Apple Watch. SiriKit will allow developers to integrate their apps with Siri.
