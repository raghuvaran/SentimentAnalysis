The iPhone maker announced in September that it had secured space in the mixed-use building. The structure is expected to open back up in 2021.On the topic of government, business and digital skills, the U.K. Prime Minister expects them to be a big part of “the future industry.” Apple Insider suggests that Brexit emerged as a topic because of how it might affect Apple’s U.K. profits, operations and abilities to move workers throughout Europe.Apple’s Tim Cook tweeted today that he also met with London’s mayor to discuss the iPhone maker’s future in the city and also the U.K. in general.The executive also went to Woodberry Down Primary School, possibly to promote the company’s educational apps like iTunes U and Classroom and deals for distribution and support for iPads and Macs. He’s reportedly been traveling through Europe all of this week. He started in France where he stopped at some stores and various areas before moving on to Germany and then to Scotland where he received an honorary degree.
