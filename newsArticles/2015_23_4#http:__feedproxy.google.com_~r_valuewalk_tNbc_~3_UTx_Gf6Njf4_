The Apple Watch may arrive sooner than initially anticipated. Although the device is supposed to arrive on Friday, the company released a statement claiming it is happy to update customers with the news that their watches may arrive a little sooner than anticipated.Apple added that its team was currently working to fill orders as quickly as they can all based on available supply. They know many customers are still facing long waiting times, and they appreciate their patience. Apple quickly sold out of watches within 24 hours of preorders beginning, and some customers were alerted that their watches would arrive in August. Some analysts speculate that the delays are the result of manufacturing issues.It isn’t clear whether the improved shipping schedules are due to cancelled orders or a faster supply chain. S&P Capital IQ Angelo Zino believes revised shipment dates mean Apple is reaching out to suppliers for better production efforts. Apple initially planned the launch date for April 24, but the company changed it to be one day earlier. The device will no longer be available at Apple stores as the watch will be sold at exclusive boutiques instead.Although Apple has yet to clarify which high-end stores will carry the new wearable, retail VP Angela Ahrendts told employees the watch would be available online. Analysts are still wondering how many smartwatches Apple will sell. Zino estimates that over 10 million devices will sell this year, and BTIG analyst Walt Piecyk estimates the number will be 30 million.Since this is the first new product category under Tim Cook’s reign as CEO, everyone is waiting to see how he reinvents the brand. This watch represents the first time Apple branched out into another market. The Apple Watch takes luxury to a whole new level. It is the first time the company made a presence in the high-end fashion market as well.
