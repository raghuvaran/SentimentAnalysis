Apple officially unveiled its highly-anticipated Apple Watch yesterday. One of the companies in the 3D printing industry that recognized a business opportunity once the Apple Watch becomes available in the market is 3D Systems.For almost two years, the technology industry had been talking about the Apple Watch. 3D Systems did not waste any time to seize the opportunity to be first to market uniquely designed Apple Watch bands.3D Systems in partnership with FreshFiber have long been working in creating unique designs for 3D printed Apple Watch bands.  Users have the option to personalize the bands for the smartwatch.Apple will be offering different types of bands for the Apple Watch  at its retail stores and online. Many third-Party companies will surely offer bands that will fit the Apple Watch.In fact, 3D Systems and FreshFiber already revealed some of their prototype designs for 3D printed Apple Watch bands. The companies are planning to sell the bands exclusively on the Cubify website.Alyssa Hoyt, director of marketing at 3D Systems told 3DPrint.com that the company is planning to produce interchangeable Apple Watch bands. The company also plans to offer 3D printed bands for other smartwatches.“We’re planning too some interchangeable bands much like what we’ve done with the Nooka watches. There’s no direct tie with Apple — this is just something we’ve been conceptualizing for the watch and may extend to other smart watches,” said Hoyt.According to 3D Systems, it will use Everlast or nylon material and print the bands for smartwatches using its Selective Sintering (SLS) machines.The company said the bands are still in the concept phase, which means the designers at FreshFiber are expected to make some changes in their designs.3D Systems and FreshFiber haven’t decided on the actual pricings for the bands for Apple Watch or other smartwatches. According to Hoyt, they will probable set the price of the bands similar to the prices of the FreshFiber cases and bands for Nooka watches, which is between $40 and $99. The price depends on the design and material used in the band.Other companies are expected to bring customized bands for the Apple Watch in the market in the future. Apple will start accepting pre-orders for the apple Watch on April 10. It will start shipping the smartwatch on April 24.It is uncertain whether 3D Systems will be able to start selling its customized bands once Apple starts shipping the Apple Watch.Source
