However, at that time, the Cupertino-based company did not provide the release date, other than saying sometime in “late October.”According to MacRumors, there are chances that AirPods could also be launched around the same time as during the iPhone event, the company did mentioned that its Bluetooth headphones will see a late October launch.

So, this partnership should ring bells for the rivals in the industry.Fitbit – the industry leader – holds several advantages over Apple’s wearable, like the Fitbit devices offers a battery life of five to ten days while Apple’s wearable needs charging every night. Fitbit also is better in terms of pricing as its products range from $60 to $250 (the starting price of Apple Watch Series 1 is $269 while for the Series 2 is $369), notes a report from The Motley Fool. Not to forget, you need an iPhone to operate Apple’s wearable while Fitbit devices is compatible with all types of smartphones.“This means that Fitbit will probably remain the best choice for consumers who are looking for basic fitness-tracking wristbands at affordable prices,” says the Motley Fool report.Talking of Apple, it also enjoys an upper hand several areas like design, brand power, and developing a full ecosystem of apps and services around the watch. Based on this, and the usability factor of Apple’s Series 2, the Motley report concludes that if “industry demand is transitioning, and consumers are demanding increasingly more functionalities from smartwatches, then Fitbit will be fighting an uphill battle against Apple.”
