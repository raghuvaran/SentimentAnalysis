Although reactions to the Apple Watch have been mixed, it is still strongly expected that Apple will release an Apple Watch 2 successor next year. Apple has invested a significant amount of resources and optimism in this device, and after strong initial sales of its Apple Watch it is a certainty that we will see the concept updated in 2016.Apple hasn’t even completed its run of the initial Apple Watch yet. The smartwatch launched in Italy, Mexico, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland and Taiwan on June 26, and is planned for release in the Netherlands, Sweden, and Thailand on July 17. But Apple is already working internally on the Apple Watch 2, hoping to improve on its first smartwatch effort.One of the first things that Apple will have to deal with when it does this is the expectations of its existing customers. One of the primary criticisms of the concept of the smartwatch is that timepieces are expected to last for many years by their very nature. Consumers who purchase such luxury watch brands as Rolex, Cartier, Omega and Patek Philippe expect the initial investment to last decades rather than years. But there are already question marks about the ability of the Apple Watch to deliver the same longevity.The Apple Watch naturally runs on computer software, and previous mobile devices released by Apple have always had a certain shelf life. While this may not be a massive issue for some of the more affordable versions of Apple Watch, the more money people have shelled out on the smartwatch, the longer they are naturally expecting it to last. And this is doubly so for the Apple Watch Edition, which resells for a bare minimum price tag of $10,000.Thus, Apple’s first challenge with the Apple Watch 2 is to ensure that its existing customers are not alienated. The last thing purchasers of the original Apple Watch want to see is an Apple Watch 2 that renders their version of the smartwatch irrelevant. So Apple Watch 2 needs to demonstrate that the Apple Watch concept has a long lifespan, while ensuring that previous Apple Watch owners do not feel left behind.Apple must demonstrate that the Apple Watch is a viable long-term product, and at the same time answer the question of how it can convince existing purchasers to upgrade, in the way that smartphone owners have persistently.Another important aspect of the Apple Watch 2 that Apple will be expected to deliver on this time round is the ability of the device to track various health features. This was promised with the first generation of the Apple Watch, yet technical problems ensured that Apple couldn’t deliver the health-tracking package that it initially promised.The corporation has a year to get things right this time round, so purchasers of the Apple Watch 2 will expect a much more holistic Health package when it is released in 2016. This is not an unreasonable expectation, as Apple explicitly featured athletes in the initial advertising wave for that watch.At this point in time, one of the major criticisms of the Apple Watch is that it doesn’t really serve any important function. Delivering health-tracking of a professional standard would begin to right this wrong, and this is something that Apple will undoubtedly be working on for the release of the Apple Watch 2.One area where Apple unquestionably got the Apple Watch right was in providing a lot of customization options for consumers. Different people have completely different needs from a smartwatch, and this was reflected in the wide variety of strap and face options that Apple delivered when the Apple Watch was released, and some well thought out price points.It is already reported that Apple will greatly increase the number of strap and face selections that consumers have to choose from when the Apple Watch 2 hit the stores, so it seems that this customization concept will expand further still. However, this issue will traverse in tandem with questions of shelf life, as purchasing a smartwatch that is perfectly customized to your individual needs is, of course, pointless if it doesn’t last for very long before being effectively bricked.The battery life of the initial Apple Watch certainly didn’t impress many consumers or critics, and Apple is expected to significantly improve this aspect of the Apple Watch 2. Central to this process, according to reports emanating from Korea, is the consumer electronics giant tightening up internal components in order to enable a larger battery to be fitted in the device.It is also notable that the recent iOS 9 operating system included power saving functionality. While the Apple Watch runs on its own unique OS, it is not too much of a stretch of imagination to predict that Apple will transfer this element to the Apple Watch in order to extend the battery life of the device.Recent reports suggest that Apple is working closely with LG and Samsung in order to produce thinner OLED displays for the Apple Watch 2. This is an interesting concept, as it contradicts previous indications that the external appearance of the device would be unchanged, and that Apple was instead concentrating on improving its specifications. It seems likely that the next generation Apple Watch 2 wearable will remain identical externally and in terms of resolution to the existing Apple Watch release.There is pressure on Apple to deliver something new with the Apple Watch 2, as it has been widely reported that many consumers are returning the device having purchased it. Native third-party app support, a nightstand mode and new watch faces are all expected in operating system updates in the near future. But Apple will doubtless be working on some outstanding new functionality in order to wow potential Apple Watch 2 consumers.
