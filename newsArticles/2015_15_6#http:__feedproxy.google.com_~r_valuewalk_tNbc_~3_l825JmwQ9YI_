Who doesn’t love free apps? Everyone does, and in fact, companies like Apple and Amazon have mastered the art of offering free apps on their respective app stores. Both offer free apps on a daily or weekly basis, and interested users can download that paid app for free for a limited time. But now, Google has also started to offer a free app promotion on a weekly basis.This promotion is named “Free App of the Week” by Google, but strangely, Google does not highlight this promotion on the front page of the Play Store. When it comes to Apple, the company always has a banner for the promotion at a particular chosen location so that the app gets highlighted.Google for some reason has chosen not to highlight it, at least not right now. So from where can you get this free app of the week? After opening the Play Store, you will be able to see a banner named “New Family Fun.” Tap on it, and it will take you to the Family section of the store. In that section, you will find the banner for the “Free App of the Week” by PBS Kids. Again, this banner does not reveal any information on which free app the user will get, but tapping on it will take the user to the free app.At the time of writing this, Google is offering Daniel Tiger’s Grr-ific Feelings by PBS Kids, which had a price tag of $2.99 but is now free for a limited time. We hope that in the future, Google makes it easy for users to know which app is being offered free instead of this lengthy procedure to know the free app’s name.Highlighting the free app on the front page of the Play Store is a good idea, but unlike other companies, right now Google doesn’t believe in doing this. But things might change in the future, and we, the users, might get better free apps then those currently being offered.
