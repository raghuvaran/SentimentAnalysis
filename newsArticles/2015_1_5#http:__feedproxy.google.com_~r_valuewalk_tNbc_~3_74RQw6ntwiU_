Earlier this week, reports surfaced that a few people with tattoos have been experiencing problems with the new Apple Watch. The tech giant responded with an update on its support page. The update includes an explanation how some tattoos can interfere with the heart rate sensor.Apple further explained permanent and non-permanent skin changes to the skin sometimes affect heart rate sensor performance. Factors including ink, pattern, and tattoo saturation can sometimes block light from the sensor. It sometimes hinders light from hitting the sensor and makes readings difficult.For people with wrist tattoos, this glitch is frustrating. Michael Lovell was just one of the people who experienced the problem. He shared video on YouTube that showed a closer look at his particular issue. He showed how the Apple Watch has no problem functioning on his tattoo-free left wrist, but it doesn’t function as good on his right wrist. He elaborated when he set up his watch; it kept asking for his passcode. He read the watch should only ask for a passcode for extra security when the wearable loses contact with skin.Lovell shared his disapointment that the watch was not compatible with this tattoos, but Apple responded by offering a fix. The tech giant then advised wearers to connect the device wirelessly to external heart rate monitor.Despite the minor glitches and issues with the new smartwatch, Apple hopes to transform the industry in a big way. We already know the watch was designed to work with the iPhone. It is dependent on the smartphone for accessing the internet or pulling data from phone apps. It doesn’t need the iPhone to function as a simple watch though. Other time-related functions continue to function without the phone including a world clock, timer, alarms, and stopwatch. Some of the device’s fitness functions like exercise tracking works without the phone.
