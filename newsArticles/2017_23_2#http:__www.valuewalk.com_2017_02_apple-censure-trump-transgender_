Now it has become the first tech company to express displeasure with Trump’s decision to repeal the guidelines around transgender bathroom use in public schools.In a statement to Recode, Apple said, “We support efforts toward greater acceptance, not less, and we strongly believe that transgender students should be treated as equals.”Last year, then-President Barack Obama introduced guidelines that encouraged public schools to allow students to use the bathroom corresponding with the gender they identify with. Any school that failed to comply with the guidelines might have ended up losing public funding. Now Trump has revoked those guidelines, and Apple disagrees with the decision.

Earlier this year, voicing opposition towards Trump’s immigration rulings, Tim Cook said that Apple simply did not support the policy. Cook also issued a memo to employees in which he wrote that diversity “makes our team stronger.” Furthermore, the iPhone maker was among the few tech companies that filed an amicus brief opposing Trump’s travel ban.Cook has not made any personal comment on Trump’s pullback of protection for transgender students, but he has strongly advocated for LGBT rights in the past. Not only did Cook call out controversial legislation related to LGBT rights, but he also donated personally to equality campaigns in various states, notes 9to5mac.Apple also participated in San Francisco’s annual Pride Parade. It even posted a YouTube video of it, in which several Apple employees were seen marching in the parade celebrating gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people. The company also backed LGBT anti-discrimination legislature at the federal level.
