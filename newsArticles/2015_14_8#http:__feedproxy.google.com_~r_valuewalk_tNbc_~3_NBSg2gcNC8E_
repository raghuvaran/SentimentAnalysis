Apple was expected to unveil its TV service next month, but recent reports claim the service could be delayed until next year.Citing unnamed sources, a report from Bloomberg says a slow pace in securing programming licensing deals from content providers is the primary reason for the delay. For supporting the service, a particular amount of network capacity is needed, which is not available with the giant as for now, the report informed readers.In May, Apple Senior Vice President of Internet Software and Services Eddy Cue detailed the hardships with developing a TV service, saying, “TV is a hard problem to solve.” He added, “One of the problems you have with a TV is you have a disparate system with a bunch of providers. There’s no standards. There’s a lot of rights issues.”Prior to September, the Web-based service was expected to be revealed in June. Apple’s service, which is expected to deliver programming over the Internet, is expected to be very similar to Sling TV, which is a Dish product, and to the upcoming service from Sony. In March, The Wall Street Journal said the service would offer programming from about 25 channels, including major networks like ABC, CBS and Fox. The service is expected to be available on all devices running on iOS.Though the Journal has not revealed the expected subscription cost for the service, it did mention that some media executives expect Apple to charge $30 to $40 a month. Sling TV from Dish offers a live TV package at a per-month price of $20 for 12 channels, including ESPN, TNT, CNN, HGTV and the Disney Channel.Apple does not want its customers to move to Google; therefore, it is aiming to create a group of products and services meeting all the entertainment-related needs of the consumers. One of the key components in Apple’s goal is the delivery of TV programs to viewers. Apple revamped its music strategy in May when it added Apple Music. The company also launched mobile-wallet platform Apple Pay in October of last year.
