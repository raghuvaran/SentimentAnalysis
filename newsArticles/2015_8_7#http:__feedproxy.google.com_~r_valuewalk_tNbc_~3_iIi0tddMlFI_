Overall demand for the new Apple Watch has apparently slowed down significantly, at least in the United States. According to a report from Slice Intelligence, the Cupertino-based tech giant is selling fewer than 20,000 watches a day. On some days, that number reportedly dips below 10,000.The decline is rather significant, especially considering that when the watch was launched in April, sale numbers were at an impressive number of 200,000 a day. Throughout April and May, the sales numbers reportedly remained steady.Not surprisingly, the Apple Watch Sport (the cheapest model) remains the most popular. Apple sold a total of two-thirds of the Sport models. Slice got its numbers from electronic receipts sent to customers via email. Since the information remains unofficial, Apple isn’t likely to make any comments on it.Apple has yet to share the official sales numbers of the Apple Watch. The company did share sales numbers and details after the launches for the iPhone and iPad. The tech giant’s chief executive officer, Tim Cook, even neglected to divulge smartwatch sales numbers during the second quarter earnings call. We may have to wait for Apple’s Q3 earnings call before we get any sales numbers for the watch.The Apple Watch is the first major product launch since former CEO and Apple co-founder Steve Jobs passed away. Although the smartwatch was never designed to replace the iPhone, it was made to complement the product and offer something more. The future of the watch is still relatively uncertain. The device received plenty of good and bad reviews since the launch, but the recent revelation of sales numbers dropping doesn’t paint a bright future for it.A reported decline in sales hasn’t stopped the rumor mill from churning out reports that Apple may have plans to launch a second Apple Watch in the near future.
