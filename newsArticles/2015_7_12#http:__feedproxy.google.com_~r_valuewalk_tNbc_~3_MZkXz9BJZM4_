Apple has increased the song upload/ matching limit for iTunes Match and Apple Music libraries to over 25,000. Eddy Cue, Apple’s SVP for Internet Software and Services, confirmed the development to MacRumors.Cue informed users that the company has “started rolling out support” for iTunes Match and Apple Music libraries of up to 100,000 songs. Previously, libraries were limited to 25,000, but now it is accommodating additional songs matched and/or uploaded.In June, a similar promise was made by Cue, who initially said that the company was “working to get to 100k for iOS 9,” which was launched in mid-September. In October, Cue restated that the work is still on going and that the update would be available “before the end of the year.”It may be assumed that the iPhone firm is doing a slow roll-out as not all users still enjoy this new facility. A similar thing was noticed in September when some accounts topped 25,000 songs, but the change was never made available to the masses.Apple’s new update now allows you to enjoy an online music library that is almost double of what Google Play Music offers (a free service). Apple charges $24.99 a year for iTunes Match or $9.99 a month for Apple Music to use the cloud locker.Apple has been strengthening its music service significantly in the last few months. In November, the company rolled out Apple Music for Android, and starting Dec. 15, Apple’s music app will also support Sonos home speaker systems. The full roll-out for Apple Music + Sonos will be seen in 2016.In separate news, the company was downgraded by equities researchers at Vetr from Strong Buy to Buy in a note issued on Monday.

Presently, Apple has an average rating of Buy and a consensus price target of $145.16.On Friday, Apple shares closed up 3.32% at $119.03.
