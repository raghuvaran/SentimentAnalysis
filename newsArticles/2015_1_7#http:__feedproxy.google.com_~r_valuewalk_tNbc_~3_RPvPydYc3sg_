Luxury automaker BMW is open to the possibility of making cars for tech giants Apple and Google. In early 2015, it was rumored that Apple was looking toward the possibility of making autonomous vehicles. There were even reports that Apple was in talks with automakers and suppliers.Oliver Zipse responded to a question about if whether BMW could build a car for tech companies when he said, “We live in a world of partnerships.”BMW is ready to stay ahead of the curve. At this year’s Consumer Electronics Show, the automaker introduced the 2016 7-Series, which includes impressive technology and safety features. Notable improvements include an overhauled iDrive with the addition of gesture and touchscreen controls. The 3D sensor was designed to detect predefined hand motions that are used for specific tasks such as answering phone calls or adjusting volume. The predefined hand motions can be used to set up to control a variety of functions.Safety is one of the most important things to consider when purchasing a car, and the new BMW 7-Series doesn’t disappoint. The car features rear collision prevention, cross-traffic warning, and Active Protection measures. The latter feature works by tightening seat belts and closing windows.Another exciting feature with the BMW 7-Series is the remote parking feature. The owner can use the Display Key to prompt the car to park in tight spaces where they might not be able to exit the car from. The new car also comes with an inline-six engine powered by gasoline. It also features a twin-scroll turbocharger, oil sump, aluminum crankcase and cylinder head.The car also comes with a significantly lower curb weight and standard adjustable air suspension. BMW gave its new car quite a makeover, and the end result is nothing short of impressive. Perhaps Apple or Google will team up with BMW in the near future to create something even more amazing.Source: Reuters
