Apple is getting in early on back-to-school shopping with an offering for students or entitled faculty members who buy a new Mac. On Thursday, Apple announced that students or entitled faculty members who buy a new Mac will get a free pair of Beats Solo 2 on-ear headphones.It appears to be an amazing offer, and it is open for all qualifying students and their parents, faculty, and staff members who buy an iMac, MacBook, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air or Mac Pro within the offer period. It must be noted that refurbished Macs or the Mac Mini also do qualify for the deal.Apple’s online store in the U.S. will start offering the deal by Aug 6, and the offer is also available at Apple retail stores and Apple Authorized Campus stores from July 23 through Sep 18. As of now, the offer is only limited to the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico, but Apple is expected to extend this offer to other countries also.The offer is basically a $200 discount, and this is the first time Apple is offering Beats headphones as a free purchase promotion. They are available in black, white, red, blue, gray and pink. Apple is also offering its Beats Solo 2 wireless headphones for just $100.Initially, the iPod was offered with the purchase of new Mac, but later Apple shifted to a gift card worth $100 for iTunes or the Mac App Store.In separate news, the Nest Learning Thermostat and the Nest Smoke Alarm is no longer available in Apple Stores. Apple confirmed to Mashable that it will no longer be selling Nest products. Even until earlier this month, users were able to find the Nest Thermostat on Apple’s online store, but now a customer’s search for the Nest thermostat or smoke alarm redirects to other HomeKit products.Apple’s decision to stop selling Google’s Nest products should not come as a surprise as only a month ago, the first HomeKit-compatible products were offered for sale. Of late, Apple has been quite choosy on what it sells in its stores. Along with cutting back on third-party products, it also is designing boxes for them to match its standards.
