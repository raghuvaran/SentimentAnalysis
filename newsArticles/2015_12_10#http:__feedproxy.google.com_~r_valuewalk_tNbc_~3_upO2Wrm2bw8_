Apple might be flaunting the 3D Touch technology in iPhone 6S and 6S Plus. But soon Samsung may bring a technology that will offer even more features than Apple’s 3D Touch. Popular Weibo user I Ice Universe (via Phone Arena) has revealed that Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S7 may sport ClearForce pressure-sensitive touchscreen technology. Synaptics, the company behind ClearForce, has partnered with Samsung for the technology.Synaptics’ ClearForce offers features like variable gaming control, screen unlock and wakeup, speed scrolling and much more based on the level of pressure applied. Huawei was the first company to announce that it would use pressure-sensitive display technology in its Mate S phablet, which is yet to hit the market. Huawei’s device will use Synaptics 3700 series display to achieve pressure sensitivity.Sources said that Synaptics was working closely with Samsung to incorporate the ClearForce technology in Galaxy S7 that is expected to arrive in February next year. It makes sense for the Korean electronics giant to jump onto the pressure-sensitive technology bandwagon. Competition in the pressure-sensitive display market is going to get fierce with the rising popularity of Apple’s 3D Touch.Another report indicates that Samsung will launch only one curved display flagship smartphone next year. And it will most likely be Galaxy S7 Edge with a 5.7-inch or 5.8-inch screen. Recently, inside sources told SamMobile that the Galaxy 7 will arrive in three different variants, each with a different processor and targeted at different markets.One Galaxy S7 model powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 820 SoC will be sold in the U.S. and Chinese markets. Another model with Samsung’s Exynos 8890 will cater to Japanese, Korean and European markets. A third variant featuring the Exynos 7422 chipset will be sold in India. The Exynos 7422 was initially rumored to power the Galaxy Note 5.
