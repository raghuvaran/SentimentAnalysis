The Apple Watch features a hidden port designed for charging. Reserve Strap initially speculated that the hidden port was for diagnostic purposes, but the creators claim that by tapping into the port, they could create special accessories enabling the watch to charge faster.The Apple Watch currently uses a magnetic charger that attaches itself to the back of the watch. The folks at Reserve Strap originally hoped to use the same method when they created the first charging strap. Once they accessed the device, they discovered that using the hidden port could allow for faster charging.The hidden port creates a more elegant solution to charging. The creators added that by utilizing the port instead of wireless charging, they can achieve a higher charge capacity. It offers a more efficient charging time and improves durability without interfering with the watch’s functionality.This discovery opens the door to other accessory makers that want to take advantage of the handy feature. There is a possibility they could also use the port to make something different. The port is available for preorder at just $250. Availability details are still unknown.After Pebble had announced the new Pebble Time Watch, the company claimed it would support third-party accessories. The accessories could be built into straps for additional capabilities. One possibility involved embedding a GPS radio into the strap to add precise location data into Pebble Time. Although Pebble embraces the concept of third-party accessory integration, Apple remains mum on the possibilities. The Cupertino-based tech giant has yet to call attention to the feature. It has yet to announce any made-for-Apple-Watch type of certifications.Apple’s reluctance to announce the existence of the port is not surprising. The tech giant tends to keep quiet about things until a formal product announcement or launch.
