Apple plans to open its largest retail store in Dubai by the end of the summer. The report comes from Khaleej Times, which cites unnamed sources.Apple has been expanding throughout the world in the last few years, and it has no plans to slow down anytime soon. The company’s retail executive, Angela Ahrendts, handles much of the expansions. This store will be the first Apple retail store in the United Arab Emirates. Although customers in that area have yet to get the brick-and-mortar experience, customers have been able to shop the tech giant’s online store.The new store will be located inside the Mall of Emirates. It will measure an impressive 50,000 square feet and feature a main entrance on the second level of the center’s fashion district. Currently, the largest Apple Store is located at Covent Garden in London. It features a total of three floors and measures 40,000 square feet. However, Dubai’s upcoming store is set to trump that by 25%.In 2014, chief executive officer Tim Cook visited the UAE to discuss education and work with local governments to improve the lives of young people. He even sat down with Mohammad Abdullah Al Gergawi (Minister of Cabinet Affairs) and other key officials.Apple remains one of the most important tech companies of today. The iPhone maker revolutionized the tech industry with quality products and solid operating systems. It also inspired a dozen of similar phones that don’t quite match up to Apple’s vision. It comes as no surprise that Apple got involved in numerous lawsuits over patents and other design issues.Apple’s retail stores also helped revolutionize the company by providing a shopping experience that focuses exclusively on the brand. It is important for Apple to expand its brand by providing brick-and-mortar retail stores in locations it wants to dominate.
