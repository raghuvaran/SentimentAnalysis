Sony just joined the ranks of other tech companies in creating cable alternatives. The Japanese tech company launched Vue, a new television streaming service for Playstation 3 and Playstation 4 consoles.Vue offers a DVR-like service. Customers can watch both on-demand programs and live television. There are over 80 channels offered through the service. The starter package costs $50 per month and includes 53 channels like NBC, CBS, Fox, CNN, MTV and more. For $70 a month, the package includes 26 extra channels including Logo, Sprout and FXM. Channels that won’t be available though Vue include ABC, Disney and ESPN.Sony’s Vue is the first package that is similar to cable packages. In February, Dish Network launched Sling TV, a streaming service with 17 channels for $20 per month. As more people continue to cancel their cable packages and cut the cord, the more tech companies respond to the demand for streaming options. Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime are three of the most popular streaming services.
