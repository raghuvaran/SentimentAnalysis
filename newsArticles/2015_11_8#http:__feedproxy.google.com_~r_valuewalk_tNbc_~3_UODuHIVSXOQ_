Apple’s previous iPhone models were marred by the so-called “Bendgate” issue, but a new video suggests the upcoming iPhone won’t have the same issue. Apple’s iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus are much-awaited by fans, and a smaller version is also rumored to be coming on Sept. 9.Apple launched two big screen devices – the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus – last year, and soon after their release, a few customers complained about the Bendgate issue with the larger 5.5-inch version. The customers complained that its frame is weak, and with a little force, it could be bent from the middle. Though the problem was “extremely rare,” Apple admitted it, and this time it seems the company has taken care of it.A new video has been released by Unbox Therapy showing leaked parts of the device. In the video, we get to see a comparison between the backplates of the iPhone 6S and the iPhone 6. The video shows there is a difference in the size of the casing. The earlier one was 138.09 mm tall and 66.91 mm wide, while the new one is 138.2 mm tall and 67.16 mm wide. The new frame is lighter than the old one by 2g despite its larger size. This is an indication of the usage of a higher grade aluminum – possibly the same as is in the Apple Watch Sport. There is a possibility that the new material could be 7000 Series anodized aluminum.From this video, it can be concluded that Apple does not want its products to have any flaws, specially the Bendgate one. However, the video should be viewed with some qualifications. It is very possible that the leaked backplate is not the final version.The Bendgate issue was seen with the Plus size device and not the smaller ones. The video does not reveal if the new design will be used in both models.We will have to wait till the device is finally launched to know if the Bendgate issue is resolved with the new devices or not, and we don’t have to wait much longer as Apple is expected to unveil the new devices next month at a special event.
