Wharton’s John Paul MacDuffie and Sharon Sandeen of Mitchell Hamline School of Law discuss the Google-Uber self-driving car lawsuit.The race between companies to be the first to perfect and commercialize driverless cars detoured last week into a court battle between the most ambitious contenders, Google and Uber. Mountain View, Calif.-based Waymo, a subsidiary of Google’s parent company Alphabet, has accused the San Francisco-based ride-sharing service of stealing its designs and other proprietary information.The route for that alleged theft is through Otto, a startup co-founded by Anthony Levandowski, a former Google executive who led the company’s self-driving car project and quit in January 2016. A few days later, he founded a startup called 280 Systems, later changed its name to Otto and sold it to Uber in August 2016 for $680 million. He now heads Uber’s self-driving cars project.“Otto and Uber have taken Waymo’s intellectual property so that they could avoid incurring the risk, time and expense of independently developing their own technology,” says Waymo in the lawsuit it filed on February 23 with the U.S. District Court in San Francisco. “Ultimately, this calculated theft reportedly netted Otto employees over half a billion dollars and allowed Uber to revive a stalled program, all at Waymo’s expense.”“This is a big deal,” said Wharton management professor John Paul MacDuffie, who is also director of the school’s Program on Vehicle and Mobility Innovation. He noted that comparisons are being made between the Waymo case and the 2012 legal battle between Apple and Samsung over alleged patent infringement “in terms of the scope of the accusations and the implications.” (Apple won more than $1 billion in damages from Samsung in that case relating to iPhone design patents.)According to Sharon Sandeen, professor of law and director of the Mitchell Hamline School of Law’s Intellectual Property Institute, the case could have either of two outcomes. One could be a settlement with cross licensing of the technology in question, where each company could benefit from the sharing of information, she said. “The other would be an all-out war to see who would win.”MacDuffie and Sandeen discussed the implications of the Waymo suit on the [email protected]/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */ show on Wharton Business Radio on SiriusXM channel 111. (Listen to the podcast at the top of this page.)At the heart of driverless cars — and Google’s charges against Uber — is the so-called lidar technology, which in itself is not proprietary, but various companies have developed it further and patented their versions. The laser-based scanning and mapping technology creates real-time 3D images that allow a vehicle to “see” its surroundings and thereby allow a self-driving vehicle to detect traffic, pedestrians, bicyclists and any other obstacles a vehicle must be able to see to drive safely, the lawsuit stated. Google had refined its lidar technology to make it sufficiently cost-effective, thereby removing a critical barrier to commercializing the technology.“[One outcome] would be an all-out war to see who would win.”–Sharon Sandeen“[Lidar] is super expensive, and getting it to be both super accurate and cheaper is a huge race now,” MacDuffie said. Ford and Baidu have partnered to invest $150 million in a firm called Velodyne that makes lidar systems, while Israel-based Mobileye also makes them, he noted.In its lawsuit, Waymo has built its case like a whodunit. Google’s investigation began after a Waymo employee was inadvertently copied on an e-mail from a supplier of lidar components to people who Waymo believes were working with Uber. Attached to the e-mail were drawings of Otto’s lidar circuit board, which Google says looked just like the Waymo design.Waymo’s lawsuit further claims that six weeks before Levandowski quit Google, he had downloaded 14,000 confidential files containing trade secrets and patented designs for self-driving cars and attempted to remove any traces of that act. In November 2015, he had founded a company called 280 Systems that later became OttoMotto. In February 2016, he founded Otto Trucking, which Google at the time didn’t see as competition. Otto was formally launched in May 2016, and by July, it had lured two other senior executives who worked on Google’s self-driving cars project. Meanwhile, Levandowski received his “multi-million dollar” severance compensation from Google. By August 2016, he sold the two Otto startups to Uber.Waymo has accused Uber and Otto of violation of trade secrets and patent infringements and sought an injunction to immediately and permanently bar the two companies from using the technology in question. “An injunction … would create huge problems for Uber,” MacDuffie said, because it would prevent the company from continuing to perfect the technology for driverless cars. Uber would also be hurt from “the public perception of it not continuing to be a lead innovator in this,” he added.The pressure to be the first to commercialize safe self-driving cars is the main driver behind the actions of the various players in this case. MacDuffie said Uber bought Otto because it saw “an existential threat” if Google ended up dominating the self-driving car market, referring to an interview in Business Insider magazine in August 2016 with Uber founder and CEO Travis Kalanick.“If we are not tied for first, then the person who is in first, or the entity that’s in first, then rolls out a ride-sharing network that is far cheaper or far higher-quality than Uber’s, then Uber is no longer a thing,” Kalanick said in that interview. Waymo in its lawsuit has cited this interview as a piece of evidence to support its accusation against Uber and Otto. “Uber felt the need to act swiftly to harness that technology and make it work for its business model,” said MacDuffie.Google had been a first mover with self-driving cars, launching its project in 2009 and making it public in 2010 with statement that “Larry [Page] and Sergey [Brin] founded Google because they wanted to help solve really big problems using technology.” By 2014, the company had developed its own “reference vehicle,” a two-door autonomous car without pedals or a steering wheel. A year later, a prototype made a road trip in normal traffic on public roads. In 2016, Google moved its self-driving car project to Waymo, created as a subsidiary of the parent Alphabet. Waymo has thus far logged more than 2.5 million miles in autonomous mode on public roads. Google, or Waymo, has conducted trials with self-driving cars “for a longer period than any other company in that space,” said MacDuffie.“Given the financial stakes, it seems like Uber would want to settle.”–John Paul MacDuffieMacDuffie noted that Levandowski was a key early Google employee in its software development for autonomous vehicles. But speed-to-market was a factor that probably drove him to leave Google and join Uber. When Uber bought Otto, Levandowski was reportedly frustrated “that Google was slow in deciding to take the big step in terms of commercializing the technology,” MacDuffie said.Meanwhile, MacDuffie said many “unknowns” exist today about driverless technology. He noted that a proliferation of different systems that operate differently will make it harder to achieve the goals of reducing accidents and
