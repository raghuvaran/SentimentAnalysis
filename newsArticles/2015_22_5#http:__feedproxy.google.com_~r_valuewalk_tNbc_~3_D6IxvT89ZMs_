Google’s Chromebook is one of the most in-demand tech products on the market today, particularly in the education sector. According to market research group Gartner, worldwide sales of the Google-based notebook are set to reach 7.3 million units in 2015.The Chromebook has yet to catch on much with businesses, although Isabelle Durand, an analyst at Gartner, said the computer has become a staple in schools around the world. The computers are affordable enough to fit in the budgets of schools, a huge plus for school districts looking for affordable alternatives to Apple products.Chromebooks are solid alternatives to Windows and Apple-based laptops. These computers cost considerably less and run on the Chrome OS. The only downside to the devices is that they don’t come with all the range of features Windows-based computers do. Although that may be what keeps most businesses from making the switch to Chromebook, it doesn’t appear to be a problem for schools and educational institutions.Some small to medium-sized businesses jumped on the Chromebook bandwagon early on, but most businesses have been slow to adopt. Durand added that Chromebooks could be a huge value for businesses that want a computer that is both simple and secure. Google recently launched Chromebook for Work, a laptop designed specifically for businesses. The computer requires users to sign on with their log in credentials once to sign on to any service or app. Google is also offering flexible pricing plans that include device and management support.Durand added, “Chromebook is a device that can be considered by SMBs or new startup companies that do not have the resources to invest too much in IT infrastructure.”The tech giant is striving to make Chromebooks a smart choice for employees. It also plans to reach out to a variety of potential customers and increase consumer knowledge of the device’s capabilities.
