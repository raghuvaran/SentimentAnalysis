Apple might give developers a chance to own an Apple Watch, even at a time when the order book is running full. Selected developers will reportedly be allowed to order the watch for delivery by April 28.According to Business Insider, many developers have confirmed that Apple is allowing them to get their hands on a 42mm Apple Watch Sport with silver aluminum case and blue sports band.A developer can register to buy one of the units upon receiving an invitation through email. Invites will be dropped to the mailboxes of developers at random and will continue to do so periodically until April 23. Developers will get the watch by April 28.Apple is looking to get feedback from its developer community, which fits perfectly with its strategy. The Apple Watch’s success relies on the number of apps and experiences, the developer community will offer it. Just like with the iPhone and the iPad, the unlocked strengths for the upcoming watch will also be recognized by third parties first. To offer customers a slew of full-fledged apps rather than those developed on the emulator, it was necessary for Apple to take this decision.Reports of the Apple Watch being prepared for shipment are surfacing now with status changing from “Processing items” to “preparing for shipments.” Those who preordered the watch on April 10 will get their delivery starting between April 24 and May 8, but the first orders are expected to be delivered on April 24, which is also the official launch date.The status was seen changing barely a couple of minutes after the iPhone maker started charging the debit and credit cards of customers who preordered the watch. According to earlier reports, bulk shipments of the Apple Watch have already been delivered to central distribution centers across the United States from China where the Apple watch was manufactured. FedEx and UPS will be responsible for shipping the watches from the central distribution centers.In an internal memo to employees last week, head of retail Angela Ahrendts said customers who have preordered the watch will receive it on Friday as decided earlier.
