A new report from LG Display claims Apple may introduce an iMac 8K in the near future. Reddit shared the link to an interesting comment from LG Display pointing towards a new iMac with an 8K display.The Cupertino-based tech giant has yet to announce plans to introduce a new iMac, but it is an interesting possibility. The new DisplayPort 1.4a standard from VESA creates a path for future displays at 7,680 x 4,320 pixels. Apple’s current highest resolution is 5,120 x 2,880 pixels.The purported press release states that Apple already announced plans to release the iMac 8K with high resolution. Apple has not publicly announced such a device, so right now this report can be filed as a false rumor. Last year, the company introduced an iMac with a 5K display. This change was a revolutionary move for the tech giant, especially considering it had not updated its standalone monitors since 2011.The future of technology remains focused on higher resolution. Many tech companies spend a lot of money creating television sets and smartphones with high-resolution displays. Apple is one of the leading technology companies that prides itself as a cutting-edge brand. The tech giant revolutionized the smartphone and tablet computer. It may soon revolutionize the wearables industry with the Apple Watch.8K displays are set to arrive in 2016, and there is a possibility Apple has something in the works involving 8K screens. The iPhone maker is expected to launch an updated Apple TV entertainment streaming box later on this year, but it probably won’t come with support for 4K streaming.The upcoming Apple TV sounds like a nice upgrade with a slimmer design and support for Apple’s expected upcoming music streaming service. Another previous rumor indicates the tech giant may soon launch a web television service ranging from $30 to $40 a month complete with 25 channels.
