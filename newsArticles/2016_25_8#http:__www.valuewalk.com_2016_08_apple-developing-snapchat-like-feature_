One of the world’s biggest technology companies is attempting to recreate the appeal that changed a small “video-texting” start-up into a social media giant to rival Twitter and Instagram. Apple is apparently looking to copy the success of Snapchat by creating their own version of the application. Snapchat, which has now found massive, mainstream success, has roughly 150 million daily users who spend anywhere between 25 and 30 minutes a day on the app. So, seeing the application’s success, it’s no surprise that Apple wants to get in on the action.“The goal behind the project’s development is to offer simple video editing with tools that appeal to the generation of users growing up with Snapchat and Instagram…” reads a report by Bloomberg.Apple is reportedly planning on developing their own video-sharing application to go head-to-head with Snapchat and Instagram as part of an effort to target younger iPhone users. The app will apparently allow its users to record video, doodle on them, and overlay features on the recording. Sound familiar?The current design of the application reportedly resembles Instagram’s new feeds, although the upcoming iOS feature will also allow users to send videos directly to other users as well as post them on other social media platforms.One thing that seemingly differentiates this application from its counterparts is that it is being designed to be used primarily with one hand. According to Bloomberg, the development teams behind Apple’s movie editing software Final Cut Pro and iMovie are behind the upcoming feature.While this is certainly what many would call a copy of Snapchat, it is definitely not the first. Last month, Instagram – which is owned by Facebook – released a brand-new feature called “Stories” which allowed its users to post videos that disappear after 24 hours. This feature is pretty much an exact copy of Snapchat’s stories feature.Apple is planning on releasing their version of Snapchat in 2017 alongside a number of other iOS features that will make social media networking more accessible. While Apple has its annual September event just around the corner, it is still unclear whether the Cupertino-based tech giant will hint at any of these features. Apple is expected to announce a new iPhone, Apple Watch, and its anticipated mobile operating system, iOS 10.
