The consensus of opinion is that Apple will radically redesign the iPhone concept before the release of the iPhone 8. This device is expected to encompass new design parameters, upgraded specs and entirely new features. Such is the power and prominence of Apple in the marketplace that there has already been a vast amount of speculation on precisely what Apple will include in this device, but here is a rundown on what we believe will be central to the iPhone 8 generation.Firstly, Ming-Chi Kuo has recently listed several aspects of what will constitute the new iPhone 8. The infamous analyst firstly suggested that Apple will remove the Home button from the smartphone completely. This has been doing the rounds as a rumor for months, but many will now be giving it serious credibility following this proposition from Kuo.Kuo suggests that Apple will replace the Home button with a ‘function area’ that will be similar to the Touch Bar on the new MacBook Pro range. There will also be a contextual aspect to this technology, enabling users to adapt the new feature depending on what activity is being conducted.Another fascinating suggestion by Kuo is that the iPhone 8 will be virtually bezel-less, dominated by the largest screen ever included in a smartphone. The shocking suggestion from the esteemed analyst is that the iPhone 8 will feature a huge 5.8-inch display. Not only will the Apple phone have a much larger display, but Kuo also believes that the actual size of the smartphone will be similar to that of the existing iPhone 7. This will be a hugely eye-catching proposition for Apple fans.Another new aspect of the iPhone 8 which seems a virtual certainty is the inclusion of OLED technology for the first time. At the very least, Apple is manoeuvring with the intention of introducing OLED, as the degree of leaks and media comment on the subject are simply too great for there to be smoke without fire. So expect Apple to move away from the LCD displays that it has relied on previously, at least in one model of the series.Kuo has also pointed to the inclusion of curved screen technology, almost certainly alongside a flat screen variant of the smartphone as well. But Apple is about to break it is curved screen duck, something that has been anticipated since the technology was openly patented some years ago.Another area where Apple could look to improve the iPhone 8 is in the photographic department. The iPhone 7 camera was perfectly adequate, but the competition is hotting up in this area, with Nokia set to release a new P1 smartphone with staggering photographic capabilities.Apple could improve the system by building the front-facing camera into the display, and ineeded this is likely considering the revelation suggested by Kuo. Dual-cameras will be retained, but there have been rumors that Apple is working on improving the low-light shooting abilities of its iPhone camera still further with the iPhone 8 in mind.One of the main areas of criticism for the iPhone range in recent years has been the relatively poor battery life that the smartphone delivers. It is it surely high time for Apple to significantly address this, rather than relying on iOS operating system improvements to deliver a minor upgrade.Thus, a larger battery in the iPhone 8 would be very welcome. This does not fit in with the overall ethos of Apple, with the company traditionally more focused on producing the most compact and attractive device possible, rather than cramming larger components into an unwieldy handset. But surely software improvements alone will not be sufficient to deliver the battery life desired in the iPhone 8, particularly considering the continuing issue that battery life remains for the iPhone.Apple has been strongly linked with wireless charging for the iPhone 8, but this feature is in limbo somewhat due to what are perceived to be technical difficulties. The consumer electronics giant was reportedly testing an extremely sophisticated system that would enable users to charge the iPhone from a further distance than had ever been possible previously.However, reports emerged that Apple was struggling to perfect this technology in time to include it in the next generation iPhone 8, so it remains to be seen whether or not it will come to fruition. But the possibility of charging smartphones at a distance of 15 feet would be an irresistible proposition for many Apple consumers.Although the iPhone 7 is water resistant, it would be a distraction to describe it as being legitimately waterproof. Many consumers would love to see an iPhone 8 that can be utilized underwater for a significant period of time, in common with such devices as the Apple Watch and Go Pro Hero5 Session.Another fascinating suggestion linked with the next generation iPhone 8 is the inclusion of a 3D Laser Sensor. J.P. Morgan suggests that this innovation will enable facial recognition; a welcome security feature.There is no doubt that Apple will be keeping tabs on developments at Samsung with regard to its new personal assistant Bixby. The Viv Labs authored software will be a major acquisition for Samsung, and you can bet your bottom dollar that Apple will respond with an upgraded version of Siri. There is no specific news on what this will entail, but Apple’s software expertise could result in an exciting personal assistant in the iPhone 8.Finally, Apple is likely to increase some of the other specs for the iPhone 8, but it would be appealing if this process was rather more ambitious than has been the case in recent years. Apple should ensure that the smartphone version of the iPhone 8 delivers full HD resolution at the very least, while it would be wonderful news if the smartphone also embraced octa-core processing.More and bigger storage options should also be provided, and could Apple possibly provide micro SD? This is the sort of flexible move that would find favor with consumers, who perhaps now believe that Apple has become too set in its ways and constricting.
