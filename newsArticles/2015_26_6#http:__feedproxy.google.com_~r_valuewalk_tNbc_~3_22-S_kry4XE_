It is the first and only band that charges Apple Watch while you wear it,” says the accessory makes in a blog post.According to the accessory maker, a single press of a button is all that is required to charge the Apple Watch. Also a LED indicator which changes color will help a user identify whether or not the watch is charged and how much charge is left, thus helping the user in deciding when to charge the gadget.The Reserve Strap is the first band developed after the complaints raised by a number of Apple Watch users about its battery life, which needs charging once in a day for most users. The Reserve Strap claims to bump that up to once every two days, and even up to a week for some less frequent users. The Reserve Strap will offer straps in two sizes, 38mm and 42mm, and the company claims it will enhance battery performance to “48 hours of functionality.” The straps will also be as resistant to water as the Apple Watch and will come in three colors: white, gray and black.The Reserve Strap is in full compliance with Apple’s Band Design Guidelines and will also not invalidate the Apple Care warranty. It makes use of the Apple Watch’s hidden diagnostic port to enable seamless charging of both the watch and the band, though unluckily, in order to charge both at the same time, one has to make use of the Micro USB port on the band rather than using the Watch’s magnetic charger.
