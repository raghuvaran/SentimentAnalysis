Apple’s iPhone 7, which was launched in September, boasted various new features such as water and damage resistance when submerged in water for more than 30 minutes. However, there were no details on what happens to these phones when they are submerged in boiling water. So to find it out, a YouTuber just did that.A YouTuber recently posted a video of an iPhone 7 submerged in boiling water. In the video, an iPhone on which a YouTube song is being played is submerged in the water for almost a minute.  The song being played on the iPhone stops and the screen goes dark, but don’t jump to any conclusions yet.To the surprise of everyone, almost all the phone’s features started working after it was taken out of the water. The second time, the phone was submerged for over 5 minutes. Again, there was no damage or smoke after it was taken out. There was a temperature warning though, suggesting that it needed some time to cool down. After 10 minutes passed, the iPhone resumed normal functions without any signs of problem.Apple has launched several ads highlighting different features of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus such as water resistance, a better camera that takes improved low light images, and extended battery life. Earlier this month, Apple released a video ad in which a man plays dramatic music on his iPhone 7 while at the pool. Later on, he takes it up where he dives from a height as the music on the iPhone climaxes. Even though the iPhone is splashed with water in the process, it worked perfectly normal.The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are projected to be the most water resistant phones by the company, with IP67 water and dust resistance. Also the water resistance feature works best when the water is not too sudsy, even though the phone is expected to survive in chlorine water, salt water, or even beer. The iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus can withstand being submerged in water for more than 30 minutes.However, users should not try to intentionally expose the phones to water, as Apple’s warranty does not cover water damage. Further, it is advised not to charge the phone when it is wet. Apart from water resistance, changes made to the Home button are among the most notable changes made to the latest iPhone. The company has also fitted the iPhone 7 with a capacitive touch area similar to the Force Touch trackpads found on the latest MacBooks.
