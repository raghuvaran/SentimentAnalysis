Recently, Apple released its latest iOS update (iOS 10.3), adding several new features and fixes that many do not care for. The new update also brings several great features, including making your iPhone run faster. iOS 10.3 also brings with it improvements to Weather Reports within Maps and CarPlay, adds Find My AirPods and Wi-Fi Calling for Verizon subscribers, and more.The latest version includes Apple’s new file system, CarPlay, and some other interface tweaks. The Verge notes that Apple’s new file system is designed to be low latency, which should improve read and write speeds on iOS devices, making them run faster.

Moreover, CarPlay has been boosted with an Apple Music Now Playing screen and status bar shortcuts.Support has also been added for searching “parked car” in Maps. There are also many AirPods users who are constantly worried about losing their small wireless headphones.

Similar to the “Find My iPhone” feature, activating the feature plays a sound on one or both AirPods while you are searching for them.Further, Apple’s virtual assistant Siri is now equipped with extra support to check the status of bills usually paid using payment apps, check the gas level in your car, and use ride-scheduling apps.The update brings several security fixes into all its software product lines as well. In all about 350 known vulnerabilities have been fixed.

Talos, a threat intelligence organization, revealed that the vulnerability also existed within Chrome, according to 9to5Mac.Despite the many vulnerabilities that Apple has fixed this week and the reports from WikiLeaks about previous exploits that the CIA used on Mac and iOS devices, users can’t still relax. In the modern world where cyber-security is most important, it is vital that users back up and secure their devices regularly.
