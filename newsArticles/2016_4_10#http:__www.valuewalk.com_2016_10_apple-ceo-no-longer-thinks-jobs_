Apple CEO Tim Cook said that the company does not limit itself to thinking about what Steve Jobs might have done. Cook said that when making decisions, the spirit of the late co-founder still guides him, but he does not sit back to wonder what decision Jobs would make, reports CNBC.Cook said at an event in Utah on Friday, “I really want [Jobs’] legacy to be with Apple 10 years from now, a hundred years from now, a thousand years from now. Not for Apple to be constrained by it. We’re not thinking, ‘What would Steve do?’ We’re not thinking that. But we’re very much married to his vision of making the best products.”Cook was present at the Utah Tech Tour, where Senator Orrin Hatch and others asked various questions on different matters such as his decision to join Apple, what he wants in his employees, the iPhone 7 and Apple’s philosophy about products.Cook says that Jobs’ spirit makes decision-making easy for him. Jobs taught him to say “no” to products that don’t enrich people’s lives even though they may appear cool. During the interaction, Cook revealed that becoming the CEO of Apple was never in his mind, but deciding to be the one was the “call of a lifetime.”Cook has been leading Apple for the past five years, and in this time period, he has gone through litmus tests several times to prove that he is the right person to fill the shoes of the innovative, charismatic and iconic Jobs. Cooks comes under the eyes of critics every now and then, even though the man is successfully running the most valuable company in the world.Cook also talked about augmented reality and feels it will be the next big thing. Cook, however, said that a lot needs to be done, and it will take time. But once it takes over the market, people will wonder how they lived without this technology for so long, just like it has become impossible to imagine life without the smartphone.Apple is keen to integrate AR technology in its devices, even though it is not going to happen any time soon. Patent filings from 2013 hint that the company is interested in having an edge over others with augmented reality technology. Last year, the Cupertino, California-based smartphone maker acquired AR software company Metaio.Cook is confident that AR technology will seep into the lives of people around the world so much that, “It will be almost like eating three meals a day..”
