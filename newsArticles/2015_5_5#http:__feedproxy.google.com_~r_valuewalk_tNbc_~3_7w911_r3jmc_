If you can’t afford to cough up anywhere between $10,000 and $17,000 to buy a gold Apple Watch Edition, some enterprising jewelers have come up with an amazing and affordable solution. Instead of paying an enormous amount for the Watch Edition, you can simply get your stainless steel Apple Watch gold plated for a fraction of the cost.Now two jewelry companies, Los Angeles-based Watch Plate and Switzerland-based Golden Dreams (via 9to5Mac) are offering gold plating services for Apple’s wearable devices. And they significantly undercut the Cupertino company’s huge price tag. Watch Plate offers the most affordable solution. For just $399, it will cover your stainless steel Apple Watch in either 24K yellow gold or 24K rose gold.Watch Plate makes the entire process quick and hassle-free. They pay for express shipping both ways. When you place your order, they email you a prepaid FedEx label. Then you have to FedEx your Watch. Watch Plate claims that they ship you your gold-plated Apple Watch within three business days of receiving it. Given the supply shortage facing Apple Watch, three days is not a big problem.Golden Dreams takes a slightly different and expensive approach. They don’t require you to already own an Apple Watch and ship it to you. Golden Dreams will soon start offering custom Apple Watch models in 18 karat rose gold, 18 karat white gold and 24 karat yellow gold for $4,200. Golden Dreams also claims to offer more than 160 different colored Alligator leather straps and custom engraving. All these watches are gold plated in Geneva and shipped worldwide.Golden Dreams said that their gold-plated Apple Watch shipped in a luxury box. The basic difference between offerings of Golden Dreams and Watch Plate is that the Swiss company handles the whole process and ships gold-plated Watch directly to buyers, though it is more expensive. Golden Dreams says that its leather straps are the same quality as Rolex.
