With consumers fascinated about potential iPhone and iPad devices for the remainder of 2015, a German retailer has given us a big insight into the future. The retailer in question has apparently listed a several unreleased 2015 iOS products in its online catalogue, even though Apple is a long way away from announcing any of them officially. Apple typically places its cards very close to its chest when dealing with new hardware releases. So if the retailer has genuinely let the cat out of the bag, we can at least be certain that it won’t be confirmed by the consumer electronics giant for quite some time.According to the listings in question, Apple will engage release an iPhone 6s, IPhone 6c and iPad Pro this year. These three devices have been strongly anticipated, with the recent rumours particular suggesting that Apple will delay the iPhone 7 until 2016. These updated versions of the iPhone 6 would therefore be the only Apple smartphone releases of 2015.Meanwhile, with Apple having updated its tablet range in 2014, it has long since been anticipated that a mega-powerful tablet would be on the cards at some point in the future. Apple is facing dwindling interest and sales in tablets, as some analysts propose that the niche has already peaked. With this in mind, the idea of a tablet in the market-leading iPad range with an extremely powerful specifications and feature lineup has been expected with the aim of stimulating interest in the iPad range.The retail listing could be a genuine mistake that provides legitimate insight into the future of Apple’s products. Or it could conceivably be a publicity stunt to attract people to the retailer. It is impossible to say at this juncture which one of these two scenarios is accurate, but what we can say is that retailers have inadvertently linked product release dates frequently in the past.Additionally, the retailer in question, 24mobile.de, has also confirmed the existence of the iPhone 6s Plus. This will not come as a huge surprise, as the first Apple tablet was released in 2014, and it has been widely expected that Apple would update this during the calendar year. The profitability of the iPhone 6 range was at least partly attributed to above expected sales of the iPhone 6 Plus, and Apple will be hoping that this is repeated with the iPhone 6s Plus.The iPhone 6c is expected to be a smaller iPhone handset aimed at the more affordable end of the marketplace. Early suggestions related to the smartphone are that it will feature a 4-inch screen, in-line with the preferences of the late founder and CEO of Apple Steve Jobs’ predilection for more compact mobile devices.Meanwhile, reports have also given Apple fans insight into what to expect from the mooted iPad Pro. The Korean publication ETNews has reported that LG Display is currently working on investment for the eighth generation line for oxide TFT processing that is located in Paju. This will apparently produce ultra-thin display technology, which will then be utilized by Apple in the iPad Pro series. With this potentially the most advanced tablet Apple has ever produced, packed with more specifications than it has ever managed to cram into previous iterations of the acclaimed series, the iPad Pro is potentially a mouth-watering device for fans of the Apple tablet range.Mac Rumors has suggested that the iPad Pro could be between 12.2-inches and 12.9-inches in terms of display size. This would mean that it is by far the largest tablet that Apple has produced, being around one-third larger than the 9.7-inch iPad Air 2. The suggested size is actually fairly close to the acclaimed MacBook Air laptop which is also produced by Apple.Although there is a significant size difference between the iPad Pro and previous Apple laptops, it is reported that Apple is motivated to retain the majority of features from the existing iPad range. Mac Rumors believes that the device will closely resemble the iPad Air 2 and the iPad Mini 3 in terms of physical build, although the advanced oxidation processes involved in producing the display of the iPad Pros suggest that this will be the slimmest iPad yet to be released.Specifications attributed to this forthcoming tablet are certainly impressive. The iPad Pro is expected to feature 2 GB of RAM, Touch ID functionality, a powerful A8X processor, and the latest version of iOS. It is not known at this juncture whether the iPad Pro will benefit from the forthcoming release of IOS 9, but this would certainly makes sense for what is evidently an extremely powerful device.In color terms, the iPad Pro seems to pretty much match the iPhone range of devices, with the tablet reputedly available in silver, gold, and space gray color options. And four integrated speakers are also reportedly included in order to boost sound and volume.Although it has been widely reported in recent weeks that Apple will delay the iPhone 7 until 2016, rumors of the release date for the iPhone 6s and 6c do contradict some recent reports. As documented by ValueWalk this week, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo stated in a research note that the Cupertino company will launch the iPhone 7 this year, skipping the 6s and 6s Plus.Kuo also challenged reports that Apple will release a smaller, more affordable iPhone with a 4-inch screen. The analyst suggested that Apple will instead completely skip an upgrade to the commercially successful iPhone 6 in 2015, and instead concentrate all smartphone resources on releasing a stellar iPhone 7 in 2016.For the time being, Apple is focusing on aggressively hiring battery technology experts with the intention of improving battery life in its future products. The Apple Watch, which is due to release in two weeks’ time, has already been strongly criticized for featuring a pretty feeble battery life. It is evident that Apple intends to solve this issue in the foreseeable future, regardless of whether we see an iPhone in 2015 or not.[Source]
