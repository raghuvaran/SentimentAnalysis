Apple has just announced when and where WWDC 2017 will be held including some other juicy bits of information. And it turns out that this year’s event will be held somewhere new, only minutes away from its Spaceship campus. Called the McEnery Convention Center, it’s in San Jose it replaces the usual Moscone Center in San Francisco.So, when will people from all over the world gather in the hope of hearing and seeing something new from Apple? The event will begin on June 5th and continues until doors close on June 9th. If you’re lucky enough to be attending, this occasion will enable you and thousands of others to meet like minded people. In fact, it doesn’t matter if you’re a developer or an engineer, you will be able to rub shoulders, discuss ideas and more.Naturally, however, a keynote address will start the proceedings and as always dominate the following activities. And as always there will be workshops where people can discuss what interested them the most.If you want to attend WWDC 2017 and rub shoulders with fellow developers and engineers apply for tickets via developer.apple.com/wwdc/. However, it’s worth informing you that it won’t be easy to get them as the demand will be high. Additionally, there will be a lottery based registration process which starts on March 27th, good luck!Apparently, the usual venue wasn’t good enough for Apple, so it searched for and came up with the McEnery Convention Center. A place which is ideally located for the thousands who will attend the event. However, one of the main pulls for this location wasn’t just the center itself. It’s located nearby to quality restaurants, hotels, and entertainment facilities, all of which will make WWDC 2017 one to remember.Apple has often used WWDC to announce early developments in new apps such as Apple Maps and Siri. And in the not too distant past, we’ve also seen hardware announced at the event. However, its primary focus is software, so don’t expect to hear anything about an iPhone 8.As for what we could expect to hear about, iOS11, watchOS 4, tvOS 11, and macOS 10.13 information is a safe bet. Although, as it often does, Apple may pull a surprise out of its hat. And that’s something that we at Valuewalk are all hoping that the Cupertino-based giant provides us with this year!What has you most excited about WWDC 2017?
