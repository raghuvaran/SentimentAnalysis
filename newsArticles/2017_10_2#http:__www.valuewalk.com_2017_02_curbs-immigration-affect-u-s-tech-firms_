In the tech realm, the scenario would have been unimaginable just a few months ago. Suddenly, and for the first time, some tech startups are hedging their bets on whether the U.S. is a hospitable place to be based, and major tech firms are adding their voices to lawsuits against the county’s president. The Trump administration’s proposed immigration restrictions are being challenged in court, but no matter the outcome, the tech sector has been seriously shaken by the executive action, experts say. “A lot of damage has been done already,” says Vivek Wadhwa, tech entrepreneur, academic and co-author with Alex Salkever of Wharton Digital Press’ The Immigrant Exodus: Why America is Losing the Global Race to Capture Entrepreneurial Talent. “I am getting emails about this many times a day, and the general mood is that people who don’t have to be here are now doubting whether they need to be here. The skilled can do well anywhere they can go. And now we are scaring everyone away. This is going to be devastating to American innovation in the long term. The worst part is that the damage has been done — it doesn’t matter if the order is reversed.”At the moment, the changes being pursued by the Trump administration are a 90-day suspension of entry into the U.S. of people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, a suspension of admissions of any refugees for 120 days and of Syrian refugees indefinitely. The status of the order was in flux after a federal judge in Seattle last week temporarily blocked enforcement. The Trump administration says it will continue to fight for the ban, and oral arguments in favor of the ban are set to be heard today in a U.S. Court of Appeals.But the administration has also reportedly set its sights on changes to H-1B visas, as well as to other temporary work permits for professionals in specialized areas. Reducing or eliminating them would have a great effect on the tech sector and the way it has traditionally structured its business.“This is going to be devastating to American innovation in the long term. The worst part is that the damage has been done — it doesn’t matter if the order is reversed.” –Vivek Wadhwa“It certainly is a big deal for these companies and the way they operate, and I think it reflects this big divide in this country that overlaid the election – that is, one person’s job-taking immigrant or H-1B is another’s valued employee,” says Peter Cappelli, Wharton management professor and director of the school’s Center for Human Resources. “So it is a pretty stark — and maybe the starkest — divide that was an underlying issue in this election that a lot of people in the tech industry maybe weren’t paying attention to, or [they were] thinking the whole issue was low-skilled illegal immigration and that it wasn’t going to affect them. And it does affect them, and to some extent many employers in the business community.”Would reducing or eliminating H-1B visas change the dynamics of the job market and spur tech companies to give these jobs to Americans instead? Hardly, says Wadhwa. “We are talking about entire companies moving, startups moving or not being here in the first place,” he says. “The jobs will move to India or China, and America won’t be doing as well as it could be doing. The majority of our tech companies make more money abroad than they do in America. Everyone is now talking about where the opportunities are better for them.”The tech sector has made good use of the H-1B visa, though the numbers have remained fairly steady since 2000. H-1B petitions increased 6% from 299,467 in FY 2013 to 318,824 in FY 2014, according to a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services report to Congress, and 65% of H-1B petitions approved in FY 2014 were for workers in computer-related occupations. These jobs were relatively well paying, with a median salary of $75,000 in FY2014 — well above what many of these workers could have earned in their home countries.However, ultimately the argument is not about what America can do for immigrants, but what immigrants can do for America. Workers arriving with an H-1B visa do so with an assurance that they work for a particular firm, and they cannot leave that job without re-applying for immigration, giving companies a kind of de facto employee loyalty that might be hard to match. The dynamic is, of course, highly attractive to firms. “No matter what else, that makes a huge difference to employers,” says Cappelli. “You are able to hire people at wages much greater than in their home country, so they are delighted to be here.”But more significantly, immigrants often become captains of innovation. About 24% of U.S. engineering and technology startup companies and 44% of those based in Silicon Valley were founded by immigrants, according to “America’s New Immigrant Entrepreneurs: Then and Now,” a paper co-authored by Wadhwa. Immigrants contributed to more than 60% of the patent filings at innovative companies such as Qualcomm, Merck, General Electric and Cisco Systems.“The protectionist argument has usually been that only a fraction of H-1Bs founded companies, and that we can tell which ones will and which won’t,” says Ravi Aron, associate professor of information systems at Johns Hopkins University. “They are partly correct in that only a fraction of H-1Bs start companies. However, they are wrong in their assumption that it is possible to tell which immigrants will and will not start companies. It is not possible to say ahead of time, ‘Welcome, Andy, we know you will start a company, please stay,’ and ‘Out, Vinod, you will only take an American job.’ The fact is that Andy Bechtolsheim and Vinod Khosla joined hands with American Scott McNealy to create Sun Microsystems.”Already, the number of “unicorns” — billion-dollar startups — located outside of the U.S. has been increasing dramatically, wrote Wadhwa in a recent piece for The Washington Post. “Fifteen years ago, almost all were in the United States, while today 86 of the 191 unicorns are in countries such as China and India. We can expect this trend to accelerate because the Trump administration has just added fuel to the fire of innovation abroad and handicapped our own technology industry.”“Apple would not exist without immigration, let alone thrive and innovate the way we do.” –Tim CookIf the concern is about the presence of H-1B visas depressing wages — wage arbitrage — there are solutions, and the current prevailing wage system could be adjusted. An auction system could make provisions for special categories such as startups, small businesses and non-profits, and then create auctions within categories, says Aron. It would set a minimum wage for each category aimed at preventing wage arbitrage. “Setting a threshold as
