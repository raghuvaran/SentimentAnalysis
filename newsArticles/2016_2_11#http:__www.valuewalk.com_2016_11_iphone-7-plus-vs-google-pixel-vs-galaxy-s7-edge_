As smartphone comparisons go, how fast a battery charges is usually way down on the list of importance. However, that’s exactly what YouTuber SuperSaf TV has been asked to compare by his subscribers, and the handsets in the spotlight are the iPhone 7 Plus, Google Pixel, and Galaxy S7 Edge. So if you want to know which handset charged the quickest, read on.Before you just straight off and go to watch the video, let’s have a look at the specs of each of the handset’s batteries.Before the release of this handset, many critics called for Apple to do something to improve the miserable battery life seen on earlier iPhones. Unfortunately, these calls fell on deaf ears. Instead, Apple focused on efficiency with the iPhone 7 Plus by making the A10 Fusion chip up to 40% more efficient than the previous A9.As for the battery itself, Apple has stuck with a non-removable Li-ion device with a 2,900 mAh capacity.In a move away from the older Nexus line of handsets, Google tasked HTC with creating a new premium Android smartphone range. In return, we now have the Google Pixel and the larger XL handset, both of which carry a non-removable battery similar to those found in the Nexus line.Specs-wise, this battery is smaller in capacity than that found on the iPhone 7 Plus at 2,770 mAh.The oldest handset in this battery comparison is the Galaxy S7 Edge. Until recently, this device had been replaced by the ill-fated Note 7, which had to be removed from sale due to battery issues. Now the Edge is the flagship again and is taking on handsets which should be carrying superior batteries.This handset packs a Li-ion 3,600 mAh battery, which is 700 mAh larger than its nearest rival, the iPhone 7 Plus. However, will this be enough to make it the winner? Let’s take a look at the test.Lined up side by side, each of the three handsets in this test was placed into flight mode. This was done to prevent any outside influences from affecting the test result, such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or incoming calls. Additionally, each handset was charged using its manufacturer-supplied plug and cable. However, the fact that both Android handsets have a fast-charging feature could be bad for the iPhone 7 Plus.Also all three handsets were charged from a 1% battery, due to the iPhone not being able to be charged when off.During the test, the charge is checked every half-hour. At the first checkpoint, it’s clear that the Galaxy S7 Edge is in the lead with a 47% charge.The Google Pixel is second with 24%, and the iPhone 7 Plus in third place with 18%. It’s now that the test moves into its second 30-minute phase. Again, the Galaxy S7 Edge leads the way, with the iPhone 7 Plus trailing in third place.After about 90 minutes of charging, the Galaxy S7 Edge displays a green light. This indicates that the handset is fully charged and is ready to be used. The Google Pixel reached a 100% charge at around 2 hours, and the iPhone 7 Plus took nearly two hours longer than the winner at 3 and a half hours.The fact that the Android handsets both feature fast-charging was of clear benefit in this comparison. However, one other factor was the battery size, with the S7 Edge having the largest of the three. This factor clearly swung the test in the Samsung smartphone’s favor.
