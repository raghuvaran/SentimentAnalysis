Volkswagen’s 2016 vehicle lineup will offer support for Apple CarPay and Android Auto. The German-based car maker announced the services are part of the new infotainment platform. Both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto bring the smartphone experience to the car dashboard. It enables users to read and send messages, listen to music, make phone calls, listen to voice mail, and use maps to navigate right on.New VW customers will also have the option to connect their smartphones to their car with Mirrorlink, a similar feature enabling users to access apps on the smartphone while viewing them on the dashboard display and hearing the audio through the speakers. The Mirrorlink app is available on select devices from HTC, LG, Samsung, and Sony.Last January, Volkswagen first announced plans to roll out the services at the Consumer Electronics Show.
