One person’s trash turned out to be quite a treasure. One woman in California brought a vintage Apple 1 computer from 1976 to a recycling center. It turns out the computer was worth $200,000. The mystery woman who donated the computer now has a check for $100,000 waiting for her as half the proceeds of the donation go to the donor.The computer was rare as it was one of the 200 computers built by Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. The donation company called Clean Bay initially thought the computer was fake, but they soon discovered it was the real deal. The first Apple 1 computer retailed for $666.66. There is speculation that only 63 of those computers are still around.The woman who donated the machine appeared to be in her 60s. She donated the computer along with a lot of other items. The company’s vice president, Victor Gichun, says he remembered her dropping off the boxes at the center. When he asked if she wanted a receipt, she declined. He also noted she drove an SUV.If and when the mystery woman arrives to collect her check, she must prove who she is.In other Apple-related news, it appears that hardly anyone is using the Apple Pay mobile payment service. A big reason most people are reluctant to use the service may have to do with the fact that small merchants don’t accept it yet. One recent report indicates that 87% of small merchants still don’t accept mobile payment systems. Larger companies and chains that accept Apple Pay include McDonald’s, Macy’s, Whole Foods and Walgreens.Although retail companies don’t get docked extra fees for accepting Apple Pay transactions, they need to invest in POS devices that work with mobile payments. They also need to teach employees to operate the system. Many small retail businesses and merchants don’t find the extra money and time to be worth it. Some small businesses hate dealing with credit cards.
