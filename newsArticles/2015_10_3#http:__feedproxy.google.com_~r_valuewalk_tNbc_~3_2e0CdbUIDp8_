The new Apple Watch, officially unveiled during Monday’s company event, is waterproof. The watch is IPX7 certified, which means it has a water-resistant design to a depth of one meter for up to 30 minutes.Although the watch itself is water-resistant, its leather bands are not. Also keep in mind that although the watch has a limited water resistant design, it is not completely waterproof. The device can be worn during sweaty workouts and in the rain, but not scuba diving. Speculation regarding the watch’s water-resistant design was initially prompted weeks ago when chief executive officer Tim Cook was overheard telling a retail store employee he wore the watch in the shower.The watch comes in a variety of designs and styles. The device also comes in a diverse price range with the lowest price watch (the 33mm Apple Watch Sport) starting at $349. The Apple Watch Edition in gold (the most expensive watch) retails from $10,000 to $17,000. The new smartwatch becomes available for pre-order on April 10th. It starts shipping on April 24th. It will be available in nine countries including the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Germany, France, China, Japan, and Hong Kong.Unlike the iPhone, the new Apple Watch wasn’t designed to store a lot of music. The device features a total of 8GB of storage, and only 2GB is available for music storage, meaning a limit of around 200 songs. Watch users can also store up to 75MB worth of photos, meaning you can keep around 100 downsized photos from the iCloud library. The rest of the watch’s storage is taken up by various apps and programs. The 8GB storage feature is not exclusive to the lower end models; even the most expensive option is limited to 8GB.
