Apple has had a merry time this holiday season as the iPhone and iPad turned out to be the most popular mobile devices among buyers, according todata from mobile analytics firm Flurry (owned by Yahoo). The analytics firm examined device activations by manufacturers between 12/19 and 12/25 and found that iOS devices were twice as popular as those from Samsung, says MacRumors.It was found that of all the new phone activations, iPhones made up 44%, while just 21% of the activations were Samsung smartphones. Just 2% to 3% of activations each were Huawei, Motorola, Oppo, Amazon and Xiaomi.“While Samsung is slowly growing in popularity throughout the holiday season, up 1% from last year, Apple devices continue to be the gift to give. Holding the third and fourth positions for activations are Huawei and LG; which is remarkable, as both manufacturers do not have an individual device within the top 35 devices activated,” Flurry said.It added that the reason these companies were able to secure high ranks is that they offer a wide variety of devices and affordable options to consumers. Google released its very much-hyped Pixel smartphone in October, but it couldn’t even make it onto the list, notes MacRumors.In Flurry’s report last year, Apple commanded a 49.1% share, while Samsung was merely at 19.8%.The popularity of smartphones and tablets by size from 5-inch to 6.9-inch is on the rise. The phablet category, including the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus, 7 Plus, and 6s Plus, made up 37% of total device activations. Medium-sized phones, such as the iPhone 6s, iPhone 7 and 4.7-inch iPhone 6, made up 45% of the activations. A decline was seen in activations of full-sized tablets such as the iPad, notes MacRumors.The quarter has been good for Apple. In late January, the iPhone maker will announce the results of the Oct-Dec quarter, the first full quarter to include iPhone 7 series sales. This fall, iPhone sales will be Apple’s strongest ever, and predictions skew as high as 78 million units.Apple products were the most-desired gifts this holiday. A recent survey by Piper Jaffray found that 7.2% respondents wanted a new iPhone, followed by a MacBook at 2.1%. The Xbox was at the third spot with just 1.45% people asking for it.On Tuesday, Apple shares closed up 0.64% at $117.26. Year to date, the stock is up more than 11%, while in the last six months it is up more than 27%.
