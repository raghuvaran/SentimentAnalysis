Also there were several guest judges: Rachel Arthur (Fashion & Mash), Thomas Tamblyn from the Huffington Post, Kieran Alger (Man V Miles), Amy Cutmore (Ideal Home), Sam Loveridge (Digital Spy), Tom Emrich (We Are Wearables), and WIRED’s Victoria Woollaston. Thousands of readers online also voted for the Wearable of the Year.According to Wareable, the Apple Watch Series 2 was chosen because it showed critics what a smartwatch can actually do. Also, according to Wareable, the company created a very desirable wearable packed with plenty of features.“When we reviewed the Series 2, it scored 4 out of 5 stars as we praised it for its good looking waterproof design, accurate swim tracking, improved notification support and reliable GPS for running,” said Wareable.Wareable also says watchOS3 has turned the Apple Watch Series 2 into a refined smartwatch experience. With its fitness, swimming and GPS features, it is a truly useful wearable, and its design, despite the inclusion of some heavy features, does know “how to make a statement,” says Wareable.Wareable said the original Apple Watch did not score well with their executive editor, James Stables, who admitted that it is a decent device but does not see it as a “world beater.”
