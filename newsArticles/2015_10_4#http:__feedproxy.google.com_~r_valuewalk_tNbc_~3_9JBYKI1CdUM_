Apple’s latest gadget in town, the Apple Watch, is now up for pre-order. If you don’t want to preorder it, then it will be available to purchase online starting April 24. Let’s get into details on how you can get your hands on the Apple Watch.Apple is expecting that demand will exceed supply at launch, and that’s why the company will be selling the Apple Watch online during its “initial launch period.” Right now Apple has not clearly said when this watch will be available in stores, but one thing’s clear. You should not stand in line for it. Instead, order it online, as the preorder period has already started.To look at the watch in person, you can visit any Apple Store. There will be three types: the Apple Watch, Apple Watch Sport and, in select stores, the Apple Watch Edition. Apple is telling customers to make appointments from the company’s website to try out the Apple Watch. However, if you fancy owning one, then there are two ways to do it.The first way is to preorder it online, and you’ll have better chances to owning the model that you want. No more standing in long queues outside of stores and fewer hassles.The second method is to reserve it for pickup in stores. You can choose your Apple Watch online and make a reservation to buy it at an Apple Store. If you choose this method, then plan your reservation early, as there will be less stock available in stores compared to online.If you choose to preorder it online, then you’ll need to pay right away, and if you choose the second “Reserve for pickup in store” option, then you’ll need to pay for the watch when you visit the Apple Store. Do note that right now Apple is not allowing customers to purchase this watch at the Store during its “initial launch period.”
