Apple has been trying hard to position the Apple Watch Series 2 as “The Gift of Go” during the holiday season. Tim Cook claims that the Series 2 Watch sales growth has been “off the charts.” Now the Cupertino company’s wearable device has got a big boost from Weight Watchers. On Thursday, Weight Watchers introduced a new OnlinePlus subscription plan, which includes giving a 38mm Apple Watch Series 2 to subscribers.The Apple Watch Series 2 will help subscribers keep track of their food intake as well as calories burned. Stacey Mowbray, President of Americas at Weight Watchers said offering Apple Watch as part of the new plan will put tracking tools and essential information on the member’s wrist.The Weight Watchers app, which is compatible with the Health app on iPhone, will allow members to receive motivating notifications, badges upon reaching goals, and helpful reminders to stay on track with their plans.The OnlinePlus membership plan costs $99.95 in the first month installment fee, followed by $34.95 monthly fee for the next 12 months. It means the total membership cost is about $520. In contrast, Weight Watchers’ standalone OnlinePlus membership costs $242 for 13 months. The 38mm Apple Watch Series 2 that Weight Watchers is offering with its new plan costs $369.If you purchase the two separately, it would cost you $661. Users could save about $109 if they were planning to join Weight Watchers, and buy the new Series 2 Apple Watch. Apple chief operating officer Jeff Williams said in a statement that Apple and Weight Watchers share the belief that “moving more each day has a powerful impact on people’s lives.”After 13 months, the membership costs $19.95 per month until you cancel. Weight Watcher told MacRumors that customers are not required to return the Apple Watch Series 2 at the end of the membership period. However, they will have to pay a $304 early cancellation fee to pay for the Watch if they cancel in the first month. The cancellation fee drops by $25.33 per month after that.Unveiled in September, the Apple Watch Series 2 looks similar to the original Apple Watch, but brings several internal improvements. The new Watch has doubled down on fitness tracking. It features a faster dual-core processor, GPS for tracking outdoor workouts, a larger battery, brighter display, and water resistance.Over the last few days, Apple has released half a dozen ads promoting the Apple Watch Series 2. Apple CEO Tim Cook recently told Reuters that the latest Watch was on track to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year. TECHnalysis analyst Bob O’Donnell said Apple Watch is a “more natural gift” compared to the iPhone or Mac.
