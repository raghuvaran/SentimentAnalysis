Apparently, Verizon is finally going to start supporting Wi-Fi calling across devices with iOS 10.3. Verizon users who have tried the first beta of the next version of iOS are reporting that there’s a new integrated option added to their iPhones. The mobile carrier is the last carrier among major U.S. cellular networks to add support for integrated calling over Wi-Fi.Mac Rumors was one of the first to spot the addition to iPhones on the Verizon network in iOS 10.3 Beta 1. The integrated calling option basically means that users will be able to take calls on any device that’s linked to the iCloud account that their iPhone is on. This means if you have an iPad, iPod touch, Apple Watch or Mac that was made no earlier than 2012, you will be able to take a call on them if they are on the same iCloud account.The iPhone doesn’t even have to be switched on or on the same Wi-Fi network as the other linked devices. This feature could come in handy if you leave your iPhone at home but you’re someplace that have Wi-Fi and you have your iPad, you will still be able take calls received on your iPhone.Verizon is the last major carrier to the party in the U.S., as Sprint, AT&T and T-Mobile already support integrated calling over Wi-Fi on iOS. Even some smaller mobile networks like MetroPCS in the U.S. and a handful of international mobile carriers supported the feature before iOS 10.3.It’s very easy to switch on integrated calling on your iPhone. To do it, just toggle the “Allow Calls on Other Devices” option to the On position. You’ll find this setting under the “Phone” menu. Then make sure that the other devices you want to take calls on are signed into the same iCloud account as your iPhone. You’ll also have to make sure they’re selected on the list of available devices in the integrated calling option on your iPhone. Once this is done, you should start seeing your calls be automatically transferred from your iPhone to your other devices.If you’re a Verizon customer and you have iOS 10.3 Beta 1 installed but don’t see the integrated calling option yet, don’t fret. It doesn’t appear to be available for everyone yet. However, by the time the full public version of iOS 10.3 is pushed out, you can expect it to be there. Also keep in mind that since iOS 10.3 is still in beta, there are likely to be some bugs with the new feature, so it’s best to be patient.
