The Apple Watch Series 2 was unveiled alongside the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus in September. The wearable device brought several improvements such as a brighter display, built-in GPS, a better processor, a bigger battery, and water-resistance. But it had the same design as the original Apple Watch. A new report coming out of China claims that the 2017 device, likely to be called Apple Watch Series 3, won’t look much different.Supply chain sources told the Chinese newspaper Economic Daily News (via Digitimes) that Taiwan-based Quanta would be responsible for the production of Apple Watch Series 3. Quanta is also the manufacturer of the original and current generation Apple Watches. The wearable device would arrive in the third quarter of this year. The Watch doesn’t get as much attention as the iPhones, so its details rarely leak out from the supply chain.It’s unclear exactly when Apple would unveil the Apple Watch Series 3. Based on the last year’s launch, we can expect the new Watch to arrive alongside the much-rumored iPhone 8 in September 2017. There have been speculations that Apple could introduce a new design with the third-generation Watch. But a new design is not in the offing. It’s probably because the Apple Watch is seen as a ‘timeless item’ that does not require exterior changes as frequently as a smartphone.People familiar with Quanta’s plans told the Economic Daily News that the new Apple Watch would see improvements in two key areas: battery life and performance. There will be no major additions to functionality, claims the Chinese publication. Sources said improving the device’s battery life was Quanta’s “main task.”The current generation Apple Watch does not suffer from poor battery life. In fact, it could last 2-3 days on a single charge. Apple might be looking to improve the battery longevity due to a higher power consumption by a more powerful CPU. The tech giant was rumored to include cellular connectivity in the Series 2. But it reportedly dropped the idea due to battery life concerns. Increasing the battery life of the Apple Watch Series 3 would allow the company to add cellular connectivity.Other rumors have suggested in the past that the Cupertino company could switch to micro-LED displays that offer improved brightness and color gamut. The micro-LED screens are also slimmer and lighter than the current displays. Citing market watchers, the Economic Daily News added that Apple sold about 7.5 million Apple Watch units in 2016, despite the smartwatch sector witnessing a slow growth.A patent application by Apple published last month indicates that the future Apple Watch models could integrate haptic feedback into the bands. It would free up some internal space that can help reduce the device’s thickness, or make room for other components. According to the patent filing, signals would be transmitted via a connector from the Watch to the band.
