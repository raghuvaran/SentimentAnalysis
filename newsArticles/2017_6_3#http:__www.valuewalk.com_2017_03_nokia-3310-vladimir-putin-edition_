The Nokia 3310 was one of the most talked-about phones this year during the MWC event. Along with making a comeback with Android smartphones, the Finnish firm updated one of its most successful feature phones, the Nokia 3310. Now this iconic phone is getting a brand new avatar: Vladimir Putin.The Russian premium handset brand Caviar launched this version of the Nokia 3310 as a tribute to Putin. The resurrected device is known as the Nokia 3310 Supremo Putin, as the picture of the Russian president is imprinted on the back of the phone in gold. Also, according to Caviar, the home button on this special handset has a small image of the Russia Federation’s coat of arms.The Nokia 3310 was launched just a couple of weeks ago and costs about 49 euros. The cover of the Putin avatar phone is made of titanium and has a gold finish. Since the phone is made of precious metal, it is priced at a hefty RUB99,000 ($1,495). For those wondering about the connection between Putin and the Nokia 3310, the phone was launched the same year Putin was elected, in 2000.Caviar states that the phone also offers “plaques with a quote from the National Anthem and a thin mesh-like engraving, applied to the body by hand.” Caviar is shipping the phone in a high-end varnished wooden case lined with black velvet.This is not the first time Caviar is doing something like this, as the company also offers a Putin-themed iPhone at a mind-boggling price, according to The Register.The revamped Nokia 3310 launched at the MWC is lighter, and its thickness has also been reduced. However, the phone looks a bit wider and taller. The softer curves and squared corners make it cuter compared to what was released in 2000. The phone’s design also makes it more comfortable to hold.The revamped phone runs on the Series 30+ OS and has a 2.4-inch QGVA display. The phone has 2 SIM card slots and a microSD card slot which can expand the storage up to 32 GB. The phone comes with 16GB of built-in storage.Although the company has retained the phone’s plastic body, it is shinier than before. The handset comes in different shades like red, yellow, orange, and blue. There is undoubtedly much hype built around the handset, but whether this enthusiasm turns into sales or not will become clear in the coming months.
