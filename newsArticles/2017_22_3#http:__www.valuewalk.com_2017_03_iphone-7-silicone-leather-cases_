The silicone cases are available in Azure (pale blue), Camellia (pinkish-red), and Pebble (light brown). They have been priced at $35 for the iPhone 7 and $39 for the 7 Plus. The leather cases are the shades of Sapphire, Taupe, and Berry.The leather cases are a bit more expensive. They have been priced at $45 for iPhone 7 and $49 for the 7 Plus. If you don’t like the new cases, you can always choose from dozens of third-party accessories. Apple said these cases were designed to fit perfectly without adding too much weight to the iPhones. On the inside, they have a soft microfiber lining to protect the phone.The Cupertino company also launched a new Saddle Brown leather case priced at $39 for iPhone SE. The new accessory for the iPhone SE is likely to attract buyers of the upgraded SE. On Tuesday, Apple doubled the storage capacity of the iPhone SE from 16GB and 64GB to 32GB and 128GB while retaining their prices. All the cases are available for purchase from Apple Stores and online.The new silicone and leather accessories seem to be a departure from the iPhone maker’s other cases that are mostly the shades of navy, tan, and gray. However, these accessories are available only for the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. If you happen to own an iPhone 6 or 6S, you’ll have to stick to the same old shades of blue, brown, black, and white.The (PRODUCT) RED iPhone 7 and 7 Plus have a vibrant red aluminum finish. They will be available online and via retail stores in almost 40 countries in 128GB and 256GB storage options starting Friday, March 24th. Part of the proceeds from RED products goes to the Global Fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. Apple partnered RED more than a decade ago. Apple’s RED lineup includes iPods, Beats headphones, and a range of accessories.If you are among those who want to go retro with their iPhones rather than buying new cases, a company named ColorWare is offering the Retro Edition iPhone 7 Plus. With its multi-color rainbow Apple logo and dark beige stripes on the edges, the Retro Edition reminds you of the vintage Macintosh. But it has been priced at a hefty $1,899.
