Apple’s big-screen iPad Pro has been rumored for years. It will be targeted at business users who want to get the work done on their tablets. Apple has introduced some major new features with the iOS 9 at WWDC 2015 that clearly point to a larger iPad, analysts believe. The iPhone maker never reveals what products it is going to launch next, but sometimes it gives us signs through software updates.Kantar WorldPanel analyst Carolina Milanesi said that the split screen feature in iOS 9 “hints at a larger iPad.” The new OS brings a QuickType keyboard to tablets with a new Shortcut bar that gives users quick access to copying and pasting tools. The Cupertino company also revealed mouse pointers for the iPads. Move two fingers along the virtual keyboard to use a cursor, which makes text selection and editing a lot easier.The real stars are Split View and Slide Over that seem to have been developed keeping the iPad Pro in mind. Split View lets users place two apps side-by-side and work with either or both. Split View would work only on the iPad Air 2, among the existing models. Slide Over allows users to select and drag a second app onto the screen, which occupies only 30% of the screen space without removing the primary app. It is for quick tasks like responding to a message.Ezra Gottheil of Technology Business Research said Apple is improving the capabilities of iPads as a business tool, but the Split View and Slide Over would work much better on the bigger iPad Pro. Moreover, Microsoft has upped the ante in the tablet space by transforming the Surface Pro 3 into a productivity powerhouse. Windows 10 coming next month will bring a plethora of features such as Continuum that will be targeted at professional users.The iPad Pro has been repeatedly delayed due to production issues related to its big screen, says KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. Last month, Mark Gurman of 9to5Mac learned from inside sources that the WiFi version of 12.9-inch iPad Pro is internally code named J98, while the WiFi + Cellular version is called J99.
