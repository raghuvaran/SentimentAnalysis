Apple’s new trade-in program in China is now active. Chinese consumers can now trade in their iPhones and iPads. The program is similar to the trade-in program in the United States.Kitty Potter, a representative for Apple, confirmed the launch of the program to the South China Morning Post. She added that customers will help the environment by recycling old devices while also scoring a deal for another device. The plan covers devices in the following Chinese territories: Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau.Unfortunately, information on pricing and sell-back information is not yet available. The trade-in policy will follow a policy similar to the U.S. policy. Store employees use a device checklist before assigning a price and then shipping the device to Brightstar.Third-party company Brightstar handles assessments when customers trade in online. In late March, it was reported that Apple supplier Foxconn would be involved with the trade-in program, but those reports haven’t been confirmed. The report claimed Apple’s retail store employees would evaluate the devices right before shipping the devices off to Foxconn. The tech supplier would then reportedly refurbish the devices before selling them online through websites like FLNet and eFeihu.Apple recently expanded its reuse and recycling program. The program now allows handsets from other companies, including Samsung, LG, HTC, BlackBerry, Nokia and Sony, for store credit trade-ins. Consumers can trade in their devices at any Apple retail store or online.The list of non-Apple phones eligible for the program includes: the Sony Xperia Z3; Samsung Galaxy Note 4; Samsung Galaxy S5; LG Nexus 5; HTC One M8; and BlackBerry 9900. The program is available in the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Italy. The recent trade-in expansion is part of Apple’s plan to lure customers way from rival Android.
