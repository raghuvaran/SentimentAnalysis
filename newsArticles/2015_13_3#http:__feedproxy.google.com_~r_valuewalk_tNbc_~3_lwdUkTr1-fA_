The biography, “Becoming Steve Jobs,” claims that Cook told Jobs that he would give him part of his liver two years before Jobs sadly died of cancer. Cook made the offer in 2009, after realizing that he had the same rare blood type as his old boss and would be able to regenerate the liver cells, according to a report by Fox News.According to a passage in the biography, Cook reportedly said: “‘Steve, I’m perfectly healthy, I can do this and I’m not putting myself at risk; I’ll be fine.’?” Despite the potentially lifesaving offer, Jobs turned Cook down and later lost his fight against pancreatic cancer on October 5 2011.Cook was previously Apple’s chief operating officer before taking over as CEO in August 2011. During his tenure he has had to come to terms with the ongoing influence of Jobs, and certain commentators have speculated as to whether Cook is capable of driving continued innovation at the tech giant.Cook unveiled the Apple Watch on Monday, which is the first new product category that the company has entered since the launch of the iPad in 2010. The Apple Watch is being marketed as a revolution in consumer gadgets, and syncs to the company’s iPhone. Analysts are predicting strong sales for the new device, which goes on sale on April 24.Interestingly fake versions have already appeared in China, selling for around $40, but hopes are high for the product and it is thought that it could make Apple the world’s first $1 trillion company.The tech world’s opinion of Cook could be changed by a strong showing with the Apple Watch, as well as other innovations such as the mooted Apple Car. The legendary Jobs was always going to be a tough act to follow, and you cannot help but wonder what direction the company might have taken had the proposed liver transplant gone through.
