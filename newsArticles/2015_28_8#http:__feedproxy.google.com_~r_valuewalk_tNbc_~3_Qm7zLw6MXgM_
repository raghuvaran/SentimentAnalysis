Google is making big strides to improve the Chrome experience, and starting on Sept. 1, the web browser will start pausing Flash-based advertisements by default. The search giant announced the welcomed change in June before rolling out the beta version for Chrome. In a recent post on Google+, the tech giant confirmed that the change will take place next month.Google noted also that it would pause Flash content it assumed was not important to specific users. It will also allow users to watch the videos they wanted to see. If a user finds a video they wanted to see paused, they could click on the item to continue playback. Halting Flash content sounds like a good idea, especially when you consider how many people rely on untethered devices like laptops or Chromebooks. Flash content drains the device’s battery and proves to be a nuisance for many users.Although Google’s change will please most Chrome users, it will surely be of concern to advertisers who used Flash for their video ads. Google said in its post that most Flash-based ads uploaded on AdWords will be converted to HTML5. Advertisers concerned about the change will need to follow a few more procedures before Sept. 1 to ensure that their ads will be converted. If their ads cannot be converted, they will have to handle the conversions themselves.According to Google’s Adwords support page, there are three ways to convert ads: allow AdWords to convert the Flash ads, create new HTML5 ads with Google tools, or upload a new HTML5 ad from a third-party server.Google isn’t the only company to shy away from Flash-based ad systems. Apple has slowly transitioned away from Adobe as well. In 2010, Apple co-founder and then-CEO Steve Jobs shared his thoughts in a blog post. He said, “Flash was created during the PC era – for PCs and mice. Flash is a successful business for Adobe, and we can understand why they want to push it beyond PCs. But the mobile era is about low power devices, touch interfaces and open web standards – all areas where Flash falls short.”
