Facebook announced its plans for a video app earlier this month, and on Thursday, it finally launched the app on the fourth-gen Apple TV. The set-top box isn’t the first device to use the app; just a day earlier, the app made its debut on selected Samsung Smart TVs, notes 9to5mac.Now, fourth-gen Apple TV owners do not have to rely on their smartphone or laptop to watch live videos posted on Facebook. They can re-watch their favorite videos and enjoy Facebook Live on Apple TV. The new app also gives recommendations based on the videos users watched before.According to the tech giant, this new app will be the main source for recent and the best content. Using this app, people will be able to watch the top live videos, videos from the pages they like, and videos uploaded by their friends. According to MacRumors, videos are divided into six channels: Top Live Videos, Recently Watched, Shared by friends, Saved Videos, Recommended for You and Following.When announcing the application a few weeks ago, the social media giant said that it would let users enjoy Facebook videos on a bigger screen. The app will not feature any ads at release, and the people must have a Facebook account to use it, said Facebook’s VP of partnerships back then. Before launching the video app, the social networking site was promoting AirPlay as the best way to see its videos on Apple TV, notes 9to5mac.The app is built into Facebook for iOS; hence, it is not a standalone app. If you are an iOS user, you will only be able to access the standard Facebook app, whereas if you an Apple TV user, you will be able to access the video app, notes MacRumors. Users can download the app from the tvOS App Store for free. The app can also be seen on the Featured home page of the tvOS App Store.It is no secret that the social media giant wants to bolster its video content and is negotiating with different media companies to do so. If recent rumors are to be believed, the company could be in talks to live-stream one MLB game a week. No official announcement from Major League Baseball or Facebook has been made, so nothing can be said for certain.
