The world of Apple and its iPhones is an ever-changing one; we’ve only just had the release of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, and we’re already talking about what comes next. Right now the rumor mill is at a fever pitch with different factions talking about an iPhone 7s and others about the iPhone 8. Here is what has been said about the possibility of each device seeing the light of day.Conventional naming “wisdom” suggests that Apple will release the iPhone 8 in 2017 because next year happens to be the tenth anniversary of the first iPhone launch. Many industry analysts and so-called “knowledgeable” people can’t see Apple going down its usual “s” route in such a year.To be honest, up until yesterday, we would have agreed with them. After all, what Apple needs right now/in 2017 is an all-conquering smartphone that will bring back the glory days and reverse slowing iPhone sales. Earlier this week we reported that the company is looking to produce an iPhone 8 with a screen that has higher resolution than the Galaxy S7. While we and others still stand firmly by that belief, new information has come to light which could throw an iPhone 7s into the mix.Bloomberg recently indicated that Apple could struggle to get all the OLED panels it requires for 2017.The report states, “The four main suppliers for such components [OLED panels] won’t have enough production capacity to make screens for all new iPhones next year, with constraints continuing into 2018.”This means that, as previously reported, Samsung could be the sole supplier of OLED panels to Apple this year and next. However, it might not be able to meet the demand put on by Apple for the iPhone 8, although some analysts suggest Apple already has contingency plans for this, such as using AMOLED technology.There have been rumors swirling that Apple could deliver three iPhone 8 models in 2017. However, the revelation that OLED panels may not be available for such a lineup has sparked new interest in the iPhone 7s. The reason is because while there will supposedly be enough panels to accommodate a certain number of iPhone 8s using OLED panels, Apple is rumored to be looking into producing two lower-spec handsets, both of which could use AMOLED panels.So a lineup for 2017 could look something like this: iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus and an iPhone 8 with an all-new glass design. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo recently issued a research note in which he stated that he believes Apple’s suppliers are gearing up for something big. Next year could see a huge upgrade cycle which may include upwards of 150 million units under production that year.He states that a premium OLED iPhone 8 will reach out to high-end users, while the lower-end iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus will both have AMOLED displays, but not much more in the way of upgrades compared to the 7 and 7 Plus beyond the display upgrade.According to analysts, each of the handsets available in 2017 will have a different size display. With the iPhone 8 sporting a 5.5-inch OLED, it could be bezel-less. However, the detail is yet to be revealed.As for what could be the two iPhone 7s models, one could be 4.7 inches, and the other 5.1 or 5.2 inches. Again, no detail other than they could be AMOLED-based is known.While rumors still float around being unsubstantiated by an official Apple announcement, you should take all of the information contained here with a grain of salt. Having said that though, it does seem like a consensus has been reached regarding the iPhone 8, meaning that Apple will do away with the Home Button, instead placing its functionality and that of the Touch ID sensor into the handset’s display.As for the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus, keep checking back.
