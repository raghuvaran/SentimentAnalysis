Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) Markets As A “Human System” & Value Investing by Todd Sullivan“Davidson” submits:Markets are understandable if you think of them as part of our ‘Human System’. If one looks at the market empirically and not try to impose what you think should occur, one can see that prices are correlated to corporate financials and economic activity over the long-term. This means that buying and selling opportunities occur far less frequently than what many believe and promote in the media. Investing with economic and business fundamentals is called ‘Value Investing’. Trading the same security several times a year (or more often) due to minor changes in price makes little sense if one is a Value Investor because Value Investors know that actual value increases slowly with businesses operating in an economic cycle which may last more than 10yrs. If one can identify good companies, that is companies which are run by CEOs who follow ‘lean’ business principles, one often finds that the holding period is equivalent to the business cycle. The goal for Value Investors then is two-fold: 1) Identify those economic indicators which let one efficiently track the business cycle and 2) Identify those portfolio managers and company CEOs who create better value during the cycle.Value Investor Approach:The Human System does not follow a mathematical formula. It is in a constant process of creative evolution which leaves the future always unknowable and at the same time better than the past. Our standard of living improves with our creativity. We operate businesses with ‘creative competition’. Businesses are formed to make profits by providing consumers with products and services which improve our standard of living. For products and services to be successful, consumers must find they provide better value than competing offerings. It is useful to think of consumer spending as directed towards those goods and services which bring improvements to one’s standard of living at the lowest cost. Those companies which offer the greatest intellectual contribution to improvements in our standard of living are rewarded with the highest profit margins.Corporate success in delivering offerings which are attractive to consumers is reflected in Net Income Margins. It is helpful to think that the more value a company uniquely provides, the greater its Net Income Margins. A good way to understand this is by examining Apple’s creation of the Smartphone category of cell phones. Apple introduced its iPhone June 27, 2007. In 2007 this was and is still the most expensive smartphone offered. It was revolutionary in what it permitted consumers to do. Consumers suddenly found a device which let them connect with people and information systems incredibly conveniently and on the run while doing other things. Up to this point consumers were overloaded taking on the multi-tasking required for modern life which was made difficult with limited access to the information, calendars and communications on which they had come to rely. Apple’s iPhone was an elegant solution. It streamlined multi-tasking leaving time for consumers to satisfy much needed personal time.  Now most consumers have smart phones. Apple’s success at meeting consumers’ needs was reflected in its Net Income Margins widening to ~26% in 2012. Since then, competitors have begun to catch up and Apple’s dominant market share has fallen as has its Net Income Margins.Apple’s Net Income Margins*: Apple’s iPhone introduction dominated the Smartphone market early on. Its widening Net Income Margins and expanding revenue resulted in its stock price holding up for most of 2008-2009’s market correction. It finally succumbed to Hedge Fund selling. Notice that the SP500 has multiple price shifts in line with those in AAPL. The SP500 is a market cap weighted index and as AAPL has grown relative to other SP500 constituents, AAPL has had an increasing impact on SP500 pricing. Beginning May 2015 AAPL has declined as revenue slows and Net Income Margins decline, but other SP500 constituents have risen. Market indices can come to be dominated by single issues and sectors which distorts short-term performance analysis. One should never benchmark a portfolio over short periods of time.Apple’s iPhone and Net Income Margins continued to dominate markets till 2012. After 2012 Steve Jobs’ product innovations ended with his passing. According to statista.com Apple’s Smartphone share peaked at 23% in 2012 and now holds ~11% share. http://www.statista.com/statistics/216459/global-market-share-of-apple-iphone/Steve Jobs impact on Apple’s financial performance and consequently it stock performance is not unique. Bill Gates as CEO of Microsoft likewise offered a software package which permitted users to greatly simplify and efficiently process information for a host of analytical purposes. It has become known as the Microsoft Office Suite. The Net Income Margins were similar to Apple’s because its value to consumers was similar.Microsoft’s Net Income Margins*: Contrast these margins with Net Income Margins of Wal-Mart(discount goods distributor*: …or Net Income Margins of Kroger(food distributor)*: Those companies which offer the greatest intellectual value to improve our standard of living are given the widest Net Income Margins by consumers. For distributors of others’ products which provide little added value to consumers. Net Income Margins are much less for discount retail stores and grocery stores. Net Income Margins are a good general measure of the intellectual value corporations add to society’s standard of living in my opinion.*Morningstar dataThe Take-Away:The Value Investor Perspective:Only a few examples are provided here of the relatively wide range of business returns.
