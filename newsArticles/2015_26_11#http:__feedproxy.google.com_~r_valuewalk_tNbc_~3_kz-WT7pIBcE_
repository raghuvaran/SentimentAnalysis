The latest news about the Galaxy S7 is that the Samsung smartphone will include new camera technology. This is known as Britecell, and it is expected to be included in the Galaxy range going forward, beginning with the flagship Galaxy S7 handset. This innovative camera technology was unveiled at the Samsung Electronics 2015 Investors Forum. With information on the arrival date of this technology still thin on the ground, the rumor mill is already suggesting that it will be included in the Galaxy S7 smartphone.Speaking at the forum, Kyushik Hong, a key member of the Korean Corporation’s LSI chip division, commented that the Britecell technology will improve sensitivity significantly in low-light shooting conditions. This ultimately results in significantly less distortion in images, and a significant reduction in the fuzziness of color. If true, these will both be major breakthroughs for smartphone photography, as the ability of mobile units to take pictures in dark conditions is notoriously shaky.In addition to this breakthrough caused by Britecell, it is also suggested that the module to be included in the Galaxy S7 is around 70 percent lower in heights than previous smartphones. This might sound like a significant reduction, but to put this into perspective this would represent roughly 1mm. So don’t expect to notice massive physical changes, but there could be a somewhat less pronounced hump around the camera lens in future Galaxy smartphones, beginning with the Galaxy S7.Other features related to the single micron Britecell camera module reportedly include super-fast phase detection autofocus. This should make taking pictures easier for the less skilled photographers among us. Additionally, Smart WDR, an HDR-style photo feature already used in Samsung’s cameras, will be included, bumping the capabilities of the Galaxy S7 range up considerably. It certainly sounds from this initial information that the Samsung gloves are off in the battle between the corporation and Apple, with the market-leading consumer electronics giant also expected to significantly upgrade the camera in the iPhone in 2016. Apple has already been linked with numerous examples of revolutionary camera technology, not least the possibility that the iPhone range will feature a professional quality DSLR snapper.What isn’t clear at the time of writing is exactly how pictures taken using this new Britecell camera module technology will differ from the previous Isocell examples. But it does seem possible that we will see this new technology debut in the Galaxy S7, with the next generation smartphone increasingly expected to be released in the early months of next year. Indeed, it now looks probable that February 21 is a possible date for the release of this smartphone, with the timing intended to coincide with the opening of the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.What should be noted is that Samsung has yet to provide an official launch date for this Britecell technology, so we cannot consider it to be an absolute certainty that it will appear in the Galaxy S7. Certainly the Korean electronics giant would love to include its fledgling technology in what is its flagship handset, but this cannot be guaranteed considering the timescales involved in preparing this. There are already some reports which have suggested that the camera technology may be held back until the latter half of 2016, in which case it would appear in a Samsung mobile phone for the first time in the Galaxy Note 6 in all probability.If Samsung decides not to include the Britecell technology in the Galaxy S7 then it is possible that the corporation will instead concentrate on a megapixel jump. It has already been suggested in some quarters that the Galaxy Note 6 may feature a 30-megapixel unit, and this could be accompanied by a 20-megapixel camera in the Galaxy S7.Camera technology will be increasingly important in smartphones in the future. The selfie generation is obsessed with taking pictures, and the cultural prominence of social media sites such as Instagram and Snapchat ensures that camera provisions in smartphones are increasingly important. It also ensures that it is not only the rear-facing snappers that are significant, with the rear units also being subjected to increasing demands from consumers.With shooting in gloomy conditions a perpetual difficulty for smartphones, Samsung could gain a significant advantage with the new Britecell technology. Apple has also attempted to address this issue by developing a new dual-sensor and lens system, but Samsung would love to include this new system in the Galaxy S7, thus giving it a clear edge over its great rival.Elsewhere in the Galaxy S7, the big debate that continues to rumble on is with regard to the processors and chipsets that will be included in the smartphone. It still seems quite likely that the Korean manufacturer will release two separate editions of the Galaxy S7 smartphone, with one in East Asia featuring the Exynos 8890 chipset, and Western markets benefiting from a unit driven by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chipset.Another interesting facet of this forthcoming smartphone will be whether the Korean corporation decides to take the plunge and release a 4K resolution smartphone. This is something that Sony has done already, and it seems increasingly likely that Samsung will follow suit sooner rather than later. Many analysts have speculated that the company will wait until later in the year before testing 4K technology with the more powerful Galaxy Note range. But it is possible in the face of lukewarm recent sales of the Galaxy S range that Samsung could take a gamble and included 4K screen resolution this time out.It has been a difficult time for Samsung lately with sales and profits both diminishing over a sustained period. The company is well aware that it needs to improve its fortunes sooner rather than later, and consumers could benefit with an outstanding Galaxy S7 handset when it is released in what is likely to be February of next year.[SOURCE]
