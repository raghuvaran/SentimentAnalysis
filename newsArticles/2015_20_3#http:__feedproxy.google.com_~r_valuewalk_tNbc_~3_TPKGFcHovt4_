A new report surfaced on Friday that claims Apple will unveil a new Apple TV box this summer. The company will also offer third-party developers a software development kit to enable them to write up applications for the upcoming TV box.The new Apple TV includes support for Siri voice input as well as an A8 processor. What’s more is that the box will come with onboard storage beyond 8GB on the current hardware system. Apple has not updated the Apple TV in years. Last month, the Cupertino-based tech giant did a price cut on the device to $69.The new A8 processor matches the current processors in the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. It will support 4K-resolution video for ultra-high definition content. Many entertainment streaming services like YouTube and Netflix offer select movies in 4K resolution. There is also a growing market for 4K TVs at competitive prices.The Siri feature on Apple TV could bring useful smartphone control options and possibly turn it into a hub for HomeKit developer tools. It also brings the possibility of HDTV games and give it a serious edge against game consoles like the Sony PlayStation 4 and Microsoft’s Xbox One. The tech giant will also add HBO Now exclusively to Apple TV in April.Apple already dominates the mobile market with its smartphones and tablets. The tech company now wants to take the center of living rooms with Apple TV. The current version offers a huge selection of movies and TV shows for streaming but has a limited selection of apps. Compared to other entertainment streaming boxes like the Roku box, Google Chromecast, and Amazon Fire TV, the Apple TV needs to get more features and apps. Fortunately, the rumored Apple TV update is likely to give the aging streaming box everything it needs to pull ahead.
