It looks like buyers of smartphones today are becoming gold bugs. Moreover, according to several recent media sources, Samsung customers are leading the rush for golden phone handsets.Apparently, more than 25% of Samsung flagship smartphone buyers have purchased gold versions of the new Galaxy S6 and Edge phones, leading to a shortage throughout Europe.Over the last few months gold has surpassed the traditionally more popular black and white colors for smartphones, which Samsung noted had surprised them. The Korean electronics giant also indicated it had begun extra production of gold handsets to keep up with booming demand.“The color gold represents wealth, abundance, high ideals, optimism and wisdom, UK lifestyle psychologist Donna Dawson pointed out. “We have been craving the material things and good times that we feel have been denied to us [due to the recession] for so long – and now that we can now see a light at the end of the tunnel, we are instinctively reaching for gold.”The Galaxy S6 has been also given a luxurious makeover courtesy of London-based customization expert Goldgenie. The innovative, curved screen Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge will be receiving a gold plating treatment.For those with more sophisticated tastes, Rose Gold and Platinum finishes will also be available from the flagship phone customizers.“Goldgenie is excited about the forthcoming launch and will be offering the Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge in their craftsmen’s signature finishes of 24k Gold, Rose Gold and Platinum,” the firm noted in a statement.Exact prices have not been announced, but Goldgenie says the 24-carat gold S6 will cost $2,400 excluding VAT. Of note, the gold plated S6 and S6 Edge are  presented in a luxurious cherry oak display case.Apple has also joined in with the soaring demand for golden gadgets. The iPhone 5s was offered as a gold smartphone back in September 2013, and was a big seller in Asian markets, especially in China. The golden iPhones sold out in Hong Kong and mainland China within hours, and demand is so strong for gold iPhone 6 and 6 Plus that smugglers are selling them for huge markups. Of interest, Apple has also produced gold versions of the iPad Air 2 and Mini 3, and recently launched a new gold 12-inch MacBook.Moreover, the new Luxury Edition Apple Watches are created from real 18-karat yellow or rose gold. These useful baubles start at around $12,000.
