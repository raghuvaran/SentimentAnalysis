Apple unveiled its latest wearable device Apple Watch and an all-new 12-inch MacBook at the recent Spring Forward event. The Cupertino company also dropped the price of its set-top box. That’s not all Apple had in store for 2015. With the upcoming WWDC in June and a few other events in the second half of this year, the world’s most valuable company is expected to introduce some exciting new products. Let’s take a look at what Apple may have in store for this year.At its recent event, the tech giant announced that it would be the first digital TV partner for the HBO Now streaming service. The service will be available to Apple TV and iOS devices in April for $15 a month. But another report from The Wall Street Journal suggests that Apple will launch its own streaming service this fall. The company is currently in talks with broadcasters to offer as many as 25 channels. It may be announced at the WWDC event in June.Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster said in a research note that Apple TV set will be the “most logical step” after the streaming service. Rumors about Apple TV have been circulating for years. The streaming service will lay the groundwork for the TV set as it will give the Cupertino company control over the content. Gene Munster expects Apple TV to be priced at around $1,500.The iPad sales have been declining dramatically, especially after the launch of the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus. According to IHS analyst Rhoda Alexander, the iPhone maker has been testing many larger display panels for the iPad Pro (or Plus). Experts believe that Apple will launch a bigger iPad so that it can continue to compete in the saturated tablet market. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted that the iPad Pro will be launched alongside a new iPad Mini in the second half of this year.Apple acquired Beats Electronics for $3 billion last year. Mark Gurman of 9to5Mac reports that Apple is planning to relaunch the Beats streaming music service at the WWDC event in June. According to PC Mag, the tech giant will undercut rivals’ pricing by offering Beats Music at just $8 per month. The service will reportedly be integrated into the OS X iTunes app and iOS music app.This is arguably the most awaited Apple product of this year. Previously, there were rumors that the iPhone 6S and iPhone 7 both might be launched in 2015. But a new report coming out of the supply chain suggests that Apple will introduce the iPhone 6S this year, and the iPhone 7 won’t arrive until 2016. The iPhone 6S is expected to feature 2GB RAM, A9 processor, and iOS 9 software. The 6S and 6S Plus will retain the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screen sizes.
