It’s also that time of year when Apple fans start speculating about the next products. With the recent influx of rumors, Apple claimed it didn’t have anything new in the works.According to a report from The Motley Fool, it seems as if Apple was holding back when it launched last year’s iPad Mini 3. The A8 processor was already well-known among the company’s crew of developers and subsequently left developers confused. The reporters from The Motley Fool believe Apple held back to cut costs. Given the fact that computer and tech parts decrease in price over years, Apple may have been hoping to save money with the A7 for at least one more year. 2015 may be the year Apple is ready to upgrade the iPad Mini 4 with the A8 processor.
