It also comes with an adjustable stand for a more comfortable experience. The official press release for the accessory highlighted specific features like an ultra thin keyboard measuring at an impressive 5.5 millimeters thick.

Users have a choice to operate it connected or separately depending on their personal preferences.

The new Type Keyboard will only enhance that experience.In other Apple-related news, the tech giant just recalled Beats XL speakers because of potential fire hazards.
