If the increased battery size in the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus wasn’t enough for you, the iPhone 7 may offer a much longer battery life. Apple is expected to release the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus this fall. These devices are expected to come with the similar battery size as their predecessor. That’s because the ‘S’ versions retain the dimension of their predecessor.But the iPhone 7 may offer a much better battery life. Since the beginning of March, the Cupertino company is aggressively hiring battery technology experts. Roger Fingas of Apple Insider has spotted as many as nine job listings related to battery technology. Of course, some of the positions may be for MacBook batteries, others focus on the iOS devices.The iOS-related listings are for a software power systems engineer, a battery life software engineer, and a power analytics engineer.  The first of the three listings says the successful candidate “will be working on design and development of software for triage of battery life issues, modeling of power consumed by different parts of the system, and analytics to understand the large-scale battery life trends.”It is clear that Apple is looking to improve battery life without actually increasing the battery size. Software and hardware improvements could help the future iPhones consume less power, leading to a better battery life. The new iPhones are likely to have a faster processor, better camera technology and more RAM.That’s in line with recent comments from Apple’s design chief Jony Ive. In an interview with the Financial Times last month, Ive indicated that he would not compromise on aesthetics to pack a bigger battery in the future iPhones. A better battery is on the wishlist of almost every prospective iPhone 7 buyer. Apple will reportedly start mass production of the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus in June. The iPhone 7 is unlikely to arrive until late 2016.
