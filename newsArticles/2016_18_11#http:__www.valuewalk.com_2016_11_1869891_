Apple’s iPhone 6 Plus was a huge success, but customers are facing some issues with the device. iPhone 6 Plus users have been complaining for several months now about touch disease,” and the company has finally come up with a solution, reports Engadget.Every day, large numbers of devices get affected with this problem, and there seems no end to it in the near future, reported several repair techs, including Jessa Jones.The symptoms of the problem are a flickering gray bar across the top of the screen and unresponsiveness of the touch screen. They continue to get worse until the problem is fixed or the phone is unusable.According to Apple’s “Multi-Touch Repair Program for iPhone 6 Plus,” the problem takes place when the device is dropped several times on a hard surface, putting stress on it. This suggests that the owners themselves are responsible for the problem.However, iFixit, citing repair experts, says that the main cause of the problem lies with the two touchscreen controller chips, or Touch IC chips, on the logic board inside the phone, which convert touch information into inputs for the phone. Apple does offer a solution to the problem, but it will cost you.“If your iPhone 6 Plus is exhibiting the symptoms noted above, is in working order, and the screen is not cracked or broken, Apple will repair your device for a service price of $149,” the iPhone firm says.Apple is offering its repair program for five years after the original sale date, says Engadget. This amount is less than the usual out-of-warranty repair price of $329 that the company charges for such repairs. Apple will reimburse the difference between the cost and $149 to those who have already paid to get their iPhone 6 Plus repaired using Apple’s service or an authorized technician. But the fact is that the issue is not free, and customers who opted to replace their phone instead of getting it fixed have nothing to gain from this program.Apple will first examine the iPhone 6 Plus devices it gets for repairs to determine the device’s eligibility for the program. The smartphone should be in a working condition. The company is limiting repair to the original country of purchase. Some owners have reportedly filed lawsuits against Apple. We will have to wait to see what impact this will have on Apple’s progress.
