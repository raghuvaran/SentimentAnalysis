Apple is adopting a conservative approach in ordering units of the rumored iPad Pro to be assembled by manufacturers, according to a report from DigiTimes. Citing supply chain sources, the report stated that the initial shipment units for the iPad Pro are far less than what industry watchers were expecting.DigiTimes reported that Apple has hired Foxconn for manufacturing the iPad Pro, and supply chain sources are expecting the device to be launched after mid-November. However, the iPad launch could be sooner as Apple follows the trend to keep its launch events in October and announce updates to its iPad lineup with new models available on retail shelves in the first week of November. It must be noted that DigiTimes has not been very reliable in the past when it comes to Apple. For instance, the website wrongly reported that an iPad with a larger display will launch in the second half of 2014, says Apple Insider.In May, Apple Insider reported that the Cupertino, Calif.-based company is working on a larger iPad that will be integrated with all new Bluetooth stylus accessories with pressure sensitivity. The larger iPad will supposedly include Force Touch, NFC and a USB-C connection port.Also recent reports have hinted about further details on the rumored 12.9-inch iPad, including code in iOS 9 which supposedly suggests a 2,732-by-2,048 pixel display and a pixel density of around 263 pixels per inch. The next software update is expected to come with a larger iPad keyboard with an extra row for traditional keyboard inputs like Tab and Caps Lock.Reports around the iPad Pro are increasing as Apple is seeing a drop in sales for its current iPads. According to tech watchers, with a stylus and large screen, the upcoming iPad will fill the needs of professionals and enterprise users who expect a full-featured alternative for a laptop.Apple chief Tim Cook has already stated that he is upbeat on the iPad over the long term. Although Cook told investors they should not expect high sales in the short run, the company could have a few tricks up its sleeve.Commenting on the dropping iPad sales, Cook said in October, “I view it as a speed bump, not a huge issue,” adding that the company wants to grow and does not like negative numbers on these things.
