According to Korean tech giant LG its upcoming V20 smartphone will be the first to run the Android 7.0 Nougat operating system.The LG V20 is set to launch in September in a crowded high-end smartphone market. The Android 7.0 Nougat OS will reportedly appear on the LG smartphone before Google’s own Nexus smartphones.In 2015, LG released the G4 and V10 smartphones. This year the company released the G5, and now it has revealed that the LG V20 will launch in September.LG released its Q2 financial results on July 28 and documents revealed that a new V series smartphone was on the cards.“The launch of the new V series and expanding sales of mass-tier K and X series models are expected to improve the business unit’s performance next quarter,” says LG.The company says that the LG V20 will ship with Android 7.0 Nougat, but did not confirm any other specifications of the upcoming smartphone.It stands to reason that the LG V20 will have improved technical specs compared to its predecessor the V10. The existing smartphone has a 5.7-inch display with 1,400 x 2,560 pixels, and also boasts a secondary customizable display.“The Second Screen is separate from your main display and keeps your favorite apps, functions and notifications at your fingertips. Even when the main display is off, Second Screen keeps you informed with the time, date and notification status, extending your battery life,” says LG.Rumor has it that the V20 will also have two displays with at least the same resolution.LG shipped the V10 with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 processor and 4GB RAM. The most common processor among flagship smartphones released this year is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820, and most have shipped with 4GB RAM. Some are hoping that the LG V20 will have a Snapdragon 820 and 6GB RAM.Samsung is also set to release a new flagship smartphone in the shape of the Galaxy Note 7. The device will be unveiled at an event on August 2 in New York City.It is predicted that Apple will launch its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus smartphones in September, priming the sector for a big battle between the companies. The LG V20 will face stiff competition from Apple and Samsung, among other manufacturers.It will be interesting to see if LG can make the V20 good enough to attract buyers away from the bigger brands. Samsung recently dislodged Apple as the biggest selling smartphone brand in the United States, so we could be in for a period of major competition as Apple attempts to wrestle back its crown.The prevailing opinion is that Apple will bring only minor innovations to the iPhone 7. The company is rumored to be working on a major redesign for the 2017 iPhone, which some have been calling the iPhone 8.Leaked photos show that the iPhone 7 looks very similar to the existing iPhone 6s. LG must be hoping that its V20 can capitalize on potentially slow iPhone 7 sales to grab some more market share, while Samsung is surely thinking along the same lines.However at this stage all of this remains speculation and should be taken with a considerable pinch of salt while we await official announcements.
