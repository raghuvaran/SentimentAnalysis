The iPhone 6S is expected to be out later this year, and rumors about it continue to circulate. This latest rumor deals with the memory chip Apple might use, which could be made by its top competitor, Samsung.The Korea Times (spotted by 9to5 Mac) reports that Apple is planning to increase the amount of storage for the mid-tier iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus, which will probably be out later this year. The website reports that Apple is talking with Samsung about making flash memory chips for the next-generation iPhone. It also states that the two companies are discussing prices and shipments for the flash memory chips. Samsung apparently lost out on Apple’s business for storage because it was charging too much in the past.The current iPhone 6 models reportedly use 16GB, 64GB and 128GB NAND chips made by SanDisk, Toshiba and SK Hynix. The Korea Times report suggests that instead of upping the 128GB option, Apple intends to increase the amount of storage for the mid-range option, according to 9to5 Mac.It would make sense for the company to get rid of the 16GB option and instead put the lowest model at 32Gb, but the report isn’t very clear. Also Apple Marketing SVP Phil Schiller said recently that Apple thinks iCloud storage makes up for the small amount of storage in the lowest-end iPhone 6S model.The Korean website also reports that Samsung is in the process of testing its newest NAND chips in a Xian, China factory. However, 9to5 Mac notes that the Korea Times has a pretty poor history when it comes to reporting Apple rumors, so thisOne of the more persistent rumors about the iPhone 6S is that it will include Force Touch, although there appears to be some debate about whether the feature will arrive on this year’s or next year’s model.Apple introduced the feature in the Apple Watch and the new MacBook Pro. It can tell the difference between a press and a tap. It should be noted though that adding the technology to the iPhone 6S may confuse current iPhone owners who are unaware of it. Apple may have to educate people about the feature, although that really shouldn’t be too hard.As of this writing, shares of Apple were up 0.98% to $125.75 per share.
