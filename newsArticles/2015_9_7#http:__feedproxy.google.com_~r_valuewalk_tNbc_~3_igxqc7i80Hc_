Apple has ordered its manufacturing partners to assemble between 85 million and 90 million iPhone 6S handsets, says a report from The Wall Street Journal. If the report is to be believed, then the iPhone maker is expecting an increase of 10% in units year over year.In 2014, the company ordered between 70 million and 80 million iPhone 6 and 6 Plus units for launch. As per The WSJ, the next-gen phone will come with Force Touch technology, which helps in differentiating between a light tap and a deep press.Apple Insider previously reported that the iPhone 6S models will come with Force Touch, a pressure sensitive touch system first launched in the Apple Watch. Also KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo previously stated that Force Touch will be coming to the iPhone 6S.Apple’s iPhone 6S is expected to have the same display sizes (4.7 and 5.5 inches) and technology as was used in the iPhone 6. Although there will probably be no dual camera system as was reported widely earlier, the smartphone is expected to come with an A9 application processor and a corresponding increase in RAM. Also there could be some more colors to choose from, which many believe could include a rose gold edition.Citing sources, the report says that the next-gen handset from Apple is dubbed the “N71” for the 4.7-inch model and the “N66” for the 5.5-inch version. The iPhone maker is also reportedly looking to sign Wistron as a third assembly partner for the new iPhones in addition to Foxconn and Pegatron. Wistron’s and Apple’s relationship goes way back, and adding Wistron as another manufacturer suggests increased production targets for the new iPhone.Further, reports are pouring in that Apple’s iPhone 6S could have faster LTE. A report from 9to5 Mac suggested that there will be a “new Qualcomm-made LTE chip” which has the capacity to deliver LTE at double the speed of the current iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.Apple was late to come up with a bigger iPhone, but still it posted record sales for the newest models. In the first half of its fiscal year, the company sold 135.6 million iPhones, which is up 43% from last year. Prior to the iPhone 6, Apple’s biggest phone had a 4-inch display.
