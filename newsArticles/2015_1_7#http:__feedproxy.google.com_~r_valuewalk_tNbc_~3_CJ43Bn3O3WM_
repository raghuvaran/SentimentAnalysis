It benefits Education Reform Now, a non-partisan 501c3 organization committed to ensuring that all children can access a high-quality public education regardless of race, gender, geography or socioeconomic status.It’s always a great night for players, spectators, and education reformers alike. The poker tournament will feature 260 players battling for prizes that last year included a seat at the WSOP Main Event, a table at Rao's and power lunches with David Einhorn, Seth Klarman and Leon Cooperman. For those attending as cocktail guests, there will be a variety of casino games including blackjack, craps and roulette. This year’s event also features a silent auction and a full swing golf simulator, which will host Long Drive and Closest to the Pin contests.The evening will be emceed by poker legend Phil Hellmuth, and others participating include poker legends Phil Ivey, Erik Seidel and Layne Flack; sports icons James Blake, Allan Houston, Alex Kovalev, Apolo Ohno and John Starks; and award-winning actors Hank Azaria, Billy Crudup and Seth Gilliam.The event is almost sold out, so reserve your seat/table today at: www.TakeEmToSchool.org. I hope to see you there!2) Below are comments I sent around two days ago to my Lumber Liquidators email list  regarding an article by “The Specialist” about why he covered his Lumber Liquidators short. Here’s an excerpt:I wonder if this article is why Lumber Liquidators is basically flat today on a big down day? This guy has written some sensible things about Lumber Liquidators in past articles – and, who knows, maybe his trading call here may prove to be right. I never have any opinion on the short-term gyrations of stocks or markets.But if I had to guess, I think he’s wrong because I totally disagree with his assertion that “Fundamentals may not matter for years to come.” I think the next earnings report, for the quarter ending tomorrow, which the company will report out on or about July 29th, will matter a huge amount. Longs are counting on at least a stabilization, if not recovery, of sales/same-store sales and margins, while shorts foresee more terrible numbers, as customers abandon the company in droves. My best source, someone within the industry, thinks it will be the latter.In addition, I think there’s likely to be bad news in the not-too-distant future from regulators, relating to both the illegal sourcing of hardwoods from Russia (Lacey Act violations) and the formaldehyde-drenched laminate, so the simple reason that the company is clearly guilty of both and it shouldn’t take regulators too much longer to figure this out.…it’s possible to make money bottom fishing the stocks of troubled companies – and make a ton of money if the fundamentals actually improve. And, yes, there may be a time to bottom fish Lumber Liquidators (at which point, hopefully I’ll be clever enough to cover most or all of my short; I doubt I’ll ever be long this stock) – but as I’ve been saying over and over again, it is MUCH too early to be trying to bottom fish it here, for two reasons:3) I’m mentioned briefly in this article in the NYT, The Loneliness of the Short-Seller (what a great contra-indicator!):The other short-sellers who remain, meanwhile, have also been proved right on occasion. Whitney Tilson reaped a windfall this year when Lumber Liquidators, a flooring company he attacked for more than a year, accusing it of selling an unsafe product, came under pressure after a report by “60 Minutes” in March. Shares of Lumber Liquidators tumbled 25 percent the day after the broadcast, which accused it of selling a type of Chinese laminate flooring that contained dangerous levels of formaldehyde.4) Two of my books made this list: These Are Wall Street's Must-Read Books of the Summer:As  things slow down a bit on Wall Street during the summer months, many of its best and brightest will find more time in their schedules to read. We asked a few of them what books were on their lists, and here are some of those must-reads. Participants were asked to give one recent book that they enjoyed as well as an all-time favorite, although some of them had so many recommendations that they couldn't narrow it down to just two.5) A very interesting article about the culture in the tech sector in US – but not in Europe – that leads to tremendous innovation here, not there:“They’re trying to recreate Silicon Valley in places like Munich, so far with little success,” she said. “The institutional and cultural differences are still too great.”There are institutional and structural barriers to innovation in Europe, like smaller pools of venture capital and rigid employment laws that restrict growth. But both Mr. Kirkegaard and Professor Moser, while noting that there are always individual exceptions to sweeping generalities about Europeans and Americans, said that the major barriers were cultural.Often overlooked in the success of American start-ups is the even greater number of failures. “Fail fast, fail often” is a Silicon Valley mantra, and the freedom to innovate is inextricably linked to the freedom to fail. In Europe, failure carries a much greater stigma than it does in the United States. Bankruptcy codes are far more punitive, in contrast to the United States, where bankruptcy is simply a rite of passage for many successful entrepreneurs.6) Funny – I had the EXACT same response when I read these three books – it was shocking to read how these three visionaries/geniuses could be so “unnecessarily cruel and demeaning” to their employees:As I was reading Ashlee Vance’s “Elon Musk: Tesla, Space X and the Quest for a Fantastic Future,” I was alternately awed and disheartened, almost exactly the same ambivalence I felt after reading Walter Isaacson’s “Steve Jobs” and Brad Stone’s “The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon.”The three leaders are arguably the most extraordinary business visionaries of our times. Each of them has introduced unique products that changed – or in Mr. Musk’s case, have huge potential to change – the way we live.I was awed by the innovative, courageous, persistent and creative ways all three built their businesses. I also love their products. I own a Mac Pro and an iPhone, and I have been a loyal customer of Apple for 20 years. I buy many books and other products on Amazon, lured by a blend of low prices, ease of purchase and reliably quick delivery. The Tesla Model S is hands down the best car I have ever driven, and it’s all electric, rechargeable in your garage.Plainly, I have bought in to what these guys are selling.What disheartens me is how little care and appreciation any of them give (or in Mr. Jobs’s
