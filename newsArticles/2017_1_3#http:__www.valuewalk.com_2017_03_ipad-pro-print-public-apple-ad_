Apple has been very aggressive lately when it comes to defending the privacy of its users. Previously, the company got into a scuffle with authorities when it denied their request to unlock an iPhone to help in an FBI investigation. Now, the Cupertino-based is changing the definition of printing documents and the way it is done.A recent ad aired by the company shows that to make sure no one peeps into the personal documents one is printing in the office, all they need to do is carry their iPad Pro and Apple Pencil to the office. Then they can sign the document displayed on the iPad Pro and send it to whomever they want. Sounds pricey!It is less of an ad and more of a campaign in which Apple does not ignore the opportunity to mock PCs. The company shows real tweets in which users complain about printing personal documents at work and having to “run to the printer to get your stuff before anyone else does.”This campaign lasts for just 15 seconds, indicating that the company is not focusing on TV ads anymore. Apparently, the company has cut its marketing budget, forcing its ad partner TBWA\Media Arts Lab to lay off people, notes AppleInsider. The Cupertino-based company is turning its focus more on regional campaigns rather than global, such as Meu Bloco na Rua for Brazil.The latest feature follows comments last week during the shareholders’ meeting. CEO Tim Cook dropped a strong hint for users and investors that Apple does care about Pro users. He also assured stakeholders that there is more to the iPad Pro in the future.“The pro area is very important to us. The creative area is very important to us in particular. Don’t think that [because] something we’ve done or something we’re doing that isn’t visible yet is a signal that our priorities are elsewhere. It’s very, very important to us.”The MacBook last got a makeover in October, the first time in five years. But it could not convince professionals who wanted the iPhone maker to show more care towards its desktop computers. Fans can expect three new models of the iPad Pro and an updated 12.9-inch tablet, a new 10.5-inch machine and an affordable 9.7-inch version of the iPad. However, there is no news on an iPad mini update for now.
