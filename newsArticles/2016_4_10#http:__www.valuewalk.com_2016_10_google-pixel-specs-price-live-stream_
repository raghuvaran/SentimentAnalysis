Later today, Google is set unveil its 2016 line of Google Pixel Android handsets. Called the Pixel and Pixel XL, they have been the stars of a vast number of leaks over the past few months. We’ll know so much more later today, but for now, here’s what we do know and what we’ve been hearing in terms of rumors.So now that Apple’s big fall event has come and gone, it’s time for Google to take center stage. The event will start at 12 p.m. in New York, 5 p.m. in London, 9 a.m. in San Fransico, or 12 a.m. if you’re in Beijing.Google will be live-streaming the Google Pixel event on YouTube. So you will be able to learn everything about the Pixel and Pixel XL launch there. However, the search giant is also expected to be announcing other pieces of hardware, such as the new Google Chromecast, a new Google router, and possibly more about Google Home.Just a few hours ago, a Reddit user spotted the Google Pixel and Pixel XL on Verizon, with prices.The 32GB Blue Pixel was listed with a retail price of $199.99, and the 128GB in Very Silver was priced at $299.99. There was also a Google Pixel XL with 128GB of storage for $419.99. It’s thought that these prices are what you’ll have to pay to secure a handset on a contract, with non-contract prices being $650 for the 32GB Pixel and around $800 for the 128GB Pixel XL.The Reddit user also stated that Verizon listed the Google Pixel and Pixel XL features. In those features, there’s something called Google Magic, but for now, no one knows what that is. Most likely, it’s going to be a new piece of software.Yesterday Carphone Warehouse leaked information and images about the specs of the Pixel and Pixel XL. Apparently both handsets will use USB-C for charging and come with 4GB of RAM. Both Pixels are expected to have a 12-megapixel sensor on the back and an 8-megapixel sensor in front.As you have seen from the leaked images above, it’s a little odd, but there will likely be two storage options, 32GB and 128GB. The lack of a 64GB option seems strange, but that could be an error on the part of the leaker. So it’s best to wait and see what the final storage options will be.Android Authority claims to have seen leaks which give away the size of the Google Pixels, with the standard (small) Google Pixel being 143.85 mm x 65.9 mm x 7.3 mm and the larger Pixel XL being 154.7 mm x 75.7 mm x 7.3 mm. Also Android Authority claims that both handsets will be 7.3mm at their thinnest point and 8.5mm at the thickest.The small Google Pixel will have (according to the leak) a 5-inch screen, while the larger Pixel XL will sport a 5.5-inch display. No one has managed to find out anything about the technology behind those displays yet. However, where performance is concerned, I can tell you that both will likely have the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chipset. Combine that with 4G of RAM, and these handsets are surely going to be as quick as anything already available.According to leaks and rumors, the Pixel and Pixel XL will run Google’s latest Android Nougat 7.1 OS. Also according to those leaks, the Nexus launcher is gone, which surely sounds the death knell for the Nexus line of handsets.These handsets certainly have some competition from the recently released iPhone 7 Plus and soon to be re-released Galaxy Note 7. However, I believe, that if Google gets its marketing right, the Pixel handsets could be a hit.
