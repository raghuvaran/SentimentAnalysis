Apple has called its new iOS 10 the “biggest ever update” to its mobile operating system. It brings significant improvements to the iMessage, Apple Music, Maps and other apps. For a moment, it seemed like Apple had finally listened to its customers who wanted the ability to get rid of the native Apple apps such as Stocks, iBooks, Calendar, News, Note, Podcasts, etc. that many people never use.Developers who installed the iOS 10 beta thought that they could delete Apple’s apps. But the truth is that you can’t permanently delete Apple’s apps from iOS 10. All you can do is hide them from the home screen and delete your data. Apple’s SVP of software engineering Craig Federighi said in a podcast with John Gruber of the Daring Fireball that the app code itself will remain on the device even after you’ve removed the Apple apps.Why can’t you delete the pre-loaded apps? It’s because these apps are “baked into iOS,” meaning the app binary remains present. Craig Federighi told Gruber that the apps are an integral part of the binary for “security signing reasons.” It also explains why Apple apps receive feature updates when the iOS is updated. Apple has been criticized in the past for forcing iPhone and iPad users to keep the built-in apps.The iOS 10 that will be rolled out to the public in September, will make the apps faster and smoother. It will boost the speed of even third-party apps that are compatible with the new OS. The Cupertino company has also given developers an option to opt out with just a single line of code, though there is little reason for them to do so.The tech giant has completely redesigned the Apple Music app to make it easier to use. It brings “greater clarity and simplicity to every aspect of the experience. With iOS 10, Apple has also opened Siri to third-party developers.
