If you love a good photo editing app and are an Android user, here is some good news. The developer of the hit iOS photo editing app Prisma has just announced its beta launch. If you’re thinking that you haven’t heard of Prisma, it could be because you have been busy playing Pokemon Go. So here’s a little background on what is becoming a worldwide photo editing phenomenon.UPDATE: 19:30 EDT: Scroll down to download Prisma App For Android [Google Play Store Link]Prisma is a hit iOS app which originated in Russia and is able to turn any ordinary image or photo into a piece of digital art. As photo editing apps go, this one certainly has some unique features, and its developers are promising much more in the near future.Prisma has been around for five weeks, and in that time, it has become the number one app in 40+ countries. And as of two hours ago, it had a staggering download count of over 7.5 million installs, which has generated a daily active user count of 1.5 million.Alexey Moiseenkov, developer of Prisma, recently said that he has a lot of cool new features being worked on for the app. These will include a Prisma Video feature and lots of new styles which will enable a user to transform any photo into a serious piece of classic art. Personally, I think the possibility of 360-degree Prisma images is the most exciting future feature, and it’s certainly something I would be interested in using.Over the last few weeks, the frustration of Android users who wanted to get their hands on the Prisma app for Android has been rising. It may be the huge amount of people who have been openly vocal about wanting it that has pushed Moiseenkov to work on the Android version of Prisma.In a recent Facebook post, Moiseenkov announced that Android users who wanted to get their hands on the app should sign up for the Prisma newsletter. This would give them the chance to be kept informed about the progress of the Android version’s development and also enable them to take part in field testing / beta testing.As of this writing, the team behind Prisma is giving away the app for free but it’s invite-only. A few users have already received the beta version of the app (which can be downloaded from below link). If you’re interested in getting your hands on the app, you will first have to sign-up for the newsletter, and after you have typed in your email and then validated your subscription, that should be it.However, I don’t think this automatically entitles you to get the Prisma app for Android. I think it just puts you on a list of interested people and will allow you to try the beta before it appears on Google Play. If you understand that this doesn’t guarantee you will get the app, click here and head on over to the Prisma site and sign up for the newsletter.As far as how long it takes to get the verification email, I’ve been waiting over 30 minutes for mine. I’ve checked my spam folder etc, but it still has not arrived so demand for it may be huge. It’s best to just be patient.Prisma Android App. (This APK does not work anymore)UPDATE 2: The downloaded app from the above apk link is closed by Prisma developers.
