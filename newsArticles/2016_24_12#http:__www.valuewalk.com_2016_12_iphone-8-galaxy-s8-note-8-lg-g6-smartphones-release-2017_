2017 is set to be a massive year for smartphones, with some incredibly important devices due to be released. So without further ado here is a rundown of the major 2017 mobiles.The tenth generation Apple flagship is the obvious place to start for 2017, with Apple expected to release something revolutionary to indeed recognize this notable landmark. It hardly seems a decade since the first iPhone was revealed, but in this 10-year period the smartphone has become by far the most dominant and recognizable piece of mobile technology on the planet.Recent Apple iPhone releases have perhaps been a little disappointing, with the consumer electronics giant accused of being rather conservative with its efforts. While CEO Tim Cook presided over some outstanding financial success in his early years in the position, since then Apple sales have begun to recede, with critics accusing the company of piling things high and selling then cheaply, as opposed to innovating.So the iPhone 8 is set to be a major departure from previous devices in the range, not least because three separate iPhone 8 models are expected. The new version is anticipated to feature a curved display and edge-to-edge design, while Apple will also likely improve the screen resolution of the device, include 3D technology in the camera, introduce wireless charging for the first time, and embrace OLED.There are many other innovations already been linked with the iPhone page, which should be expected in September 2017.It would be fair to say that 2016 was not the most salubrious in the history of Samsung, following the Galaxy Note 7 debacle. It is difficult to recall a bigger disaster in the history of smartphones than a major release which exploded on a regular basis and that was thus forced to be completely recalled!Samsung will attempt to respond to this mini-tragedy by releasing two outstanding smartphones in 2017. And the first of these will be the Galaxy S8, expected to hit the market, as usual, in the first quarter of next year.The Korean corporation has already noted in a press release that its mobile business faces massive pressure in the next 12 months. “The Mobile business saw its earnings decrease significantly QOQ due to the effects of the discontinuation of the Galaxy Note7. However, smartphone shipments remained solid due to continued stable sales of its existing flagship devices, including the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, and steady growth in the mid-tier Galaxy A and J series,” a press release noted. Clearly Samsung has some work to do to get back on track and regain the positive momentum it had developed before the exploding Note 7 issue came to light.Samsung must hit the ground running with the Galaxy S8, thus we can expect some outstanding specifications for this smartphone. It is even possible that this could be the first 4K resolution smartphone that Samsung has released, but regardless of this the Galaxy S8 should be the highlight of the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February.It now also seems likely that Samsung will not discard the Galaxy Note branding, and will instead released the eighth generation of this mobile next year. Samsung obviously has a lot of work to do to restore the brand image of this particular device, but the Galaxy Note series had built up a significant amount of good will prior to the Note 7.If the Galaxy S8 does not include a 4K resolution display, it seems almost a certainty that the Galaxy Note 8 will. Samsung has a policy of innovating with the Galaxy Note range, and we should expect this to be a particularly outstanding device.OnePlus has built up a significant following with solid, reliable, expensive and flexible smartphones, and this new release should be intriguing. It is worth noting that OnePlus may skip the branding of OnePlus 4, owing to the number being considered unlucky in China. Thus, the next-generation smartphone from the company could instead be branded as the OnePlus 5.Early reports on this mobile competitor suggest that a ceramic body will dominate the exterior of the device, with massive updates in both software and hardware also expected, meaning that this could be the first quad HD smartphone from OnePlus.Google has yet to become the major player in the smartphone niche that it would undoubtedly like to be, but perhaps the Pixel 2 to can begin to change this. Many believe that previous Google Pixel releases are truly outstanding, but that the relatively high price tag has prevented the smartphone from becoming a mainstream device.Nonetheless, Google is expected to update the Pixel still further in 2017, and this should be an adventurous and exciting smartphone when it is released. Because of the embryonic nature of the smartphone range, it is not certain when the Google Pixel 2 will be released, or precisely what will be involved. But Google would be particularly advised to ensure that the Pixel 2 is presented at a competitive price point.LG has produced some wonderful smartphones over the years, and the LG G5 was particularly well-received critically. However, the Korean corporation has never been one willing to stand still, and of course the company has confirmed that the G6 will not feature a modular component.This means a significant reinvention of the flagship smartphone once more, suggesting that there will be big changes to the design of this mobile. An LG release is always intriguing, as the company arguably takes more risks than any other smartphone competitor. So the LG G6 will be well worth looking out for in 2017.Finally, the welcome return of Nokia to the smartphone marketplace, with two new Android-driven handsets, will be intriguing to monitor. Early reports on these devices suggest that Nokia will focus on delivering outstanding display quality, unique design and excellent battery life to ensure convenience. Can Nokia become a major smartphone player again in 2017? Watch this space…
