Apple plans to introduce a “Deep Blue” color option to replace Space Gray for the upcoming iPhone 7, according to Japanese-language website Macotakara, which in the past has provided accurate predictions. The new color will reportedly be offered alongside the already-available Rose Gold, Silver and Gold.It is “highly likely” that Apple will nix the Space Gray color, introduced in 2013 with the iPhone 5s, from the iPhone lineup, says Macotakara, citing sources in the company’s supply chain. The darker slate used on the iPhone 5 was replaced by the lighter shade. Since then, the color has found its way to other Apple products also, like the iPad Pro, iPad Air and 12-inch MacBook.Apple has steadily added color options to its iPhone lineup. The tech giant debuted a white color option alongside the black iPhone 3G in 2008. Later, the company renamed the white option Silver with the iPhone 5s. With the iPhone 5s, the company also debuted the Gold color option. Most recently, the tech giant added the Rose Gold option with the iPhone 6s.In addition, the report says the iPhone 7 will keep the same LCD glass display that current models of the iPhone have. This supports an earlier report that said no major display upgrades are expected until 2017.As per rumors, the design of the upcoming iPhone 7 will pack updated internals, like a 256GB storage tier, a faster A10 chip, and a dual-lens camera system for the larger iPhone 7 Plus variant. LG Innotek will reportedly be taking over from long-time supplier Sony and will be supplying a majority of the dual-camera modules bound for the iPhone 7 Plus, according to the most recent rumors.The latest rumors suggest the new iPhone will have a design similar to that of the iPhone 6 and 6s. As has been talked about before, the iPhone 7 may not include a 3.5mm headphone jack but could include additional features, such as waterproofing, faster LTE and Wi-Fi chips, adjusted antenna bands, and more. More radical changes will be coming to the upcoming iPhone in 2017. The tech firm is expected to unveil the iPhone 7 this September.On Thursday, Apple shares closed up 0.72% at $99.65.
