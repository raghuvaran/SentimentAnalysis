The latest iPhone 6S and 6S Plus have retained the design elements of their predecessors. But the next year’s iPhone 7 is expected to bring some radical design changes. ValueWalk reported a couple of weeks ago that the U.S. Patent and Trademarks Office (USPTO) has granted Apple patent for a “glass wraparound design.” The Cupertino company may use this technology in its future iPhones to give them cylindrical, spherical or any other shape.We have seen numerous iPhone 7 concepts over the past few weeks. Now Mesut G. Designs has released a new concept video that imagines what the iPhone 7 would look like if Apple used its patented “glass wraparound design” technology in the next year’s device. Mesut G. Designs imagines a slim handset with a bezel-less display. Bezels on the top and bottom of the screen have also been minimized.On the back, you could see dual speakers at the bottom, the iconic Apple logo and an unobtrusive rear camera. Since it features a wraparound display, there are no physical volume buttons on the side. They have been replaced with virtual volume buttons. The Home button has also been removed. Apple’s patent describes that the display could be folded such that the videos and images would appear as if they are coming from a “continuous loop.”KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claimed last month that the iPhone 7 would be insanely thin, even slimmer than the latest iPad Air 2 and iPod touch. The current iPhone 6S and 6S Plus are 7.1mm and 7.3mm thick. But the next year’s phone could be between 6mm and 6.5mm thick. Besides, the iPhone 7 is expected to feature a hexa-core A10 processor supplied by Samsung, TSMC and Intel.Apple has also patented a gesture-based system to enter the passcode that works in conjunction with the TouchID fingerprint sensor. The new technology tracks how a specific dot is tapped, not just which dot is tapped by the user. What’s more, supply chain sources in Asia have told Mac Otakara that the iPhone 7 will boast of a waterproof and dustproof design.
