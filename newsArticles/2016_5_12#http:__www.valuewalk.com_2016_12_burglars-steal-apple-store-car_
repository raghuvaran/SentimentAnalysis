An SUV rammed into the Apple Store Sunday morning in downtown Palo Alto, and around 10 burglars looted the store. All of them were in hoodies, and according to the Palo Alto Police Department. Officials said four suspects, two adults and two minors, were detained, reports Patch. Investigators are looking for the others who were involved in the crime.Someone informed the Palo Alto Police about the incident at 340 University Ave. at 4:38 a.m. A rented gray 2016 Kia Soul was found abandoned on the sidewalk in front of the store. Also there was another vehicle involved in the theft, a black 2013 Hyundai Sonata, police said, but there was no one inside. The Hyundai Sonata was parked in the Lane 20 West alleyway, adjacent to City Parking Garage S at 445 Bryant St., across the street from the Apple Store, stated police. Further, police found a number of stolen Apple computers and phones scattered on the ground.A spokesperson said, “A review of video surveillance footage from the Apple store showed that eight to 10 suspects crawled into the store through the hole in the glass and stole a large number of items.”Out of the four arrested suspects, two were males, ages 16 and 17, from Oakland whose names were concealed by police due to their ages. Both of them were taken to Santa Clara County Juvenile Hall, reports Patch. Two adults, Erica Jaynisha White, 18, and Shaquin K. Ferguson, 19, were also arrested. Ferguson is out on parole for weapons violations, according to police.The losses due to the theft are not yet known, as Apple is still calculating them. Apple spokesman Nick Leahy stated that the company does not comment on security matters but said that the store will reopen on Monday, according to Mercury News.According to police, thieves have hit the same store several times over the past six months, but crashing a car into the store wasn’t involved before. However, there have been similar robberies targeting Apple stores in San Francisco, Berkeley, Burlingame, Corte Madera and Los Gatos. Detectives are searching for a possible connection between this robbery and other burglaries at Apple Stores in the Bay Area. As of now, police have not connected the four arrested suspects with any other case.Though police have not issued any description of the burglars, anyone who has information about the burglary may call Palo Alto Police dispatch at 650-329-2413.
