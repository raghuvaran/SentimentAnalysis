2015 is half over, but there are still a number of exciting smartphone releases to come in the second half of the year. Here ValueWalk counts down some of the most significant mobile releases due in the remainder of 2015.The monumental success of the iPhone series ensures that there will certainly be a new iPhone in 2015. The iPhone 6S will be the sequel to the phenomenally successful iPhone 6.General expectations are that the iPhone 6s will share the basic physical design of its predecessor, with any changes implemented by Apple limited to internal specifications. Two models with 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays as in the previous iPhone generation is thus anticipated, but Apple could be tempted to increase the screen resolution of the devices.Force Touch is also expected to play a central role in the iPhone 6s, with the new method of interactions that it entails. This has already been a success in the first Apple smartwatch, the Apple Watch, and it is now being widely reported that it will make its way to the new iPhone 6s and iPad tablet series.Apple has already previewed the iOS 9 operating system at its Worldwide Developers Conference, and this software is expected to be included in the iPhone 6s as well. Other suggestions about the device are that Apple will produce it from a revolutionary form of aluminum, and that wireless charging will be included.The Galaxy Note 5 will be an extremely significant release for Samsung, as the Galaxy Note 4 was very well receivedGalaxy Note series at the IFA in Berlin, and this policy is expected to be replicated with the Galaxy Note 5 announced this year around September 2.It is anticipated that Samsung will release a traditional Galaxy Note 5 device, and also a dual-edge curved screen variant dubbed the Galaxy Note 5 Edge. Rumors have also suggested that Samsung could release the first ever mass-market 4K resolution device. A metal and glass finish is also likely.Considering that the Galaxy Note series is now becoming as significant as the flagship Galaxy S smartphone, Samsung is expected to arm this release with impressive specifications. A 21-megapixel rear camera along with a 6-megapixel front camera is possible, alongside a proprietary Exynos processor and 6GB of RAM.With a Galaxy S7 release also possible this year, Samsung is likely to pull out all of the stops in order to differentiate this device from its flagship smartphone.Google will already be beavering away on its next Nexus smartphone, and there are rumors that Huawei could be manufacturing the next device in the series. Google has previously worked with Motorola and LG, but with Huawei occupying an ever more significant position in the consumer electronics marketplace, it is suggested that Google will pair up with the Chinese company.Aside from this aspect of the smartphone, it is also suggested that the device will feature a 5.7-inch OLED display. A 1,440 x 2,560-pixel resolution has been mooted, making this a quad HD device.The Nexus will probably feature a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 chipset, and 4 GB of RAM is also expected. Hardware support will also probably match up with the recent Android M operating system release, which could mean a fingerprint scanner and USB Type-C support.The smartphone will likely launch in late 2015, with October a convenient date for Google.The BlackBerry Oslo is the latest in a long line of BlackBerry mobiles, with this latest iteration a makeover of the earlier Passport release. Specifications for this device have already been leaked, and this has incited a good deal of excitement among BlackBerry fans. Many die-hard BlackBerry devotees are completely committed to the Passport, even though its results in the consumer segment are not particularly impressive.The Oslo has seemingly adopted a retro appearance for 2015, with a silver metal and plastic frame and rubberized grip notable. Spec leaks indicate that this device features a Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor, 3GB of RAM, a 13-megapixel camera and a pretty hefty 3,450mAh battery.It is already expected that BlackBerry will release the Oslo in both Europe and North America before the year is out.The Moto X is the latest attempt from Motorola to break into the mainstream of the smartphone industry. The company has recently been bought out by Lenovo, and the third generation of the Moto series is already rumored to be under development.Murmurings related to specs indicate that the smartphone will feature a 5.2-inch quad HD display, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 processor, 4GB of RAM, 32 / 64GB of memory, a 16-megapixel Clear Pixel camera, a 5-megapixel front-facing camera, and a 3,280mAh battery. It certainly seems that the Moto X will sit favorably among the existing smartphone elite.Moto X is a name that has already been used by Motorola, so it is not precisely known how this smartphone will be named. But we do know that Motorola has recently slashed the price of the existing model, suggesting that it is attempting to clear out old stock ahead of a new release.HTC continues to produce critically acclaimed devices that have yet to hit the mainstream in the West in particular. This latest HTC release has already being officially confirmed and released in its native marketplaces, and it certainly appears to be a progressive device.Construction has been a particular focus of this smartphone, but it also has extremely decent internal specifications. The octa-core MediaTek chipset is extremely impressive and will ensure that this the M9+Â is a very slick operator. A 20-megapixel dual-camera will also be included in the device, and HTC has certainly armed this device with enough punch to make a serious impression in Europe and North America.This device will be released before the end of 2015 in Europe and North America, with July a likely date.
