Authorities in California have arrested one suspect after a reported laptop theft from a building owned by tech giant Apple.News of the arrest came as authorities said that they were still looking for two other suspects, according to AP. Security guards at the Apple building called police after spotting a getaway car speeding away from the building in Cupertino at 4.30 a.m. on Wednesday.According to Sgt. James Jensen, deputies had visual contact with the car and chased it into a nearby neighborhood. After the car was disabled, all three suspects ran away on foot.One suspect was found at a branch of popular coffee chain Starbucks after trying to use a bathroom that was locked. The other two escaped into the neighborhood, pursued by police officers.The Californian city of Cupertino is home to Apple’s corporate headquarters, and the laptop could have been a sensitive prototype or contain information related to future products.According to a report from Bloomberg on Wednesday, the tech giant is planning to update its MacBook Pro laptop range for the first time in 4 years. The report cites people familiar with the matter who requested not to be named.The new notebooks will be thinner than previous models and feature a touch screen strip packed with function keys. It is thought that the new range will include models with more efficient graphics processors aimed at video gamers.Sources claim that the new computers have been undergoing advanced testing since earlier this year. Another source has denied that the new computers will be unveiled at a planned Apple event on September 7.While some people, including Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, thought that laptops could be replaced by tablets, the notebook computers continue to enjoy strong sales. The Mac range, which includes the MacBook Pro, saw sales rise 6% to $25.5 billion over the last fiscal year. In contrast sales of the iPad dropped 23% to $23.2 billion.The planned overhaul of the MacBook range is apparently an attempt to drive sales, as consumers are replacing iPads at a slower rate. Apple data shows that consumers upgrade iPads around every 3 years, while iPhones are upgraded every 18-24 months. This provides an explanation as to why iPad sales have fallen from their 2013 peak.
