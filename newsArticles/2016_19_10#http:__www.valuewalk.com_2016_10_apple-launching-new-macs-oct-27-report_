Apple will introduce new Macs at its October 27 event, says Recode, citing unnamed sources. Last month, the company released MacOS Sierra but did not introduce any new computer models sporting the software. Hence, this has pretty much been expected for a long time.Apple last made significant updates to its top-of-the-line MacBook Pro in 2012. Since then, the only changes made have been a Retina display and a Force Touch trackpad. Excluding the 12-inch MacBook, Apple’s entire Mac lineup is currently at least a year old. A Bloomberg report stated earlier that Apple’s fall hardware event might include a new iMac desktop, MacBook Pro laptops, a new MacBook Air and a new standalone 5K monitor.Rumors suggest that the new MacBook Pro will be slimmer than the existing one and sport a flatter keyboard and a “Dynamic Function Row” or might have a touchscreen OLED strip in lieu of standard function keys, notes The Verge. Amid ongoing rumors about the specs, the top most has been that the new MacBook Pro will sport a row of customizable touchscreen keys, notes Recode.Most of Apple’s recent events were held in San Francisco, including the iPhone 7 event, but the Mac event is expected to take place at or near Apple’s Cupertino campus, notes Recode. As of now, there has been no comment from Apple about the matter.For the past few years, PC sales have been declining, but Mac computers had been unaffected by the decline until this year, when even the Mac saw a drop, as per global research firm IDC. Apple sold 4.8 million Macs in the second quarter of last year, but sales dropped to 4.4 million this year, with many deferring purchases.The holiday season is fast approaching, and this move from Apple (if true) will come just in time to put the new products on sale. The iPhone maker has not made any significant change to any of its Mac models for a long time, and experts have been advising customers to hold off on new purchases until Apple updates the lineup.Next week will be very eventful. Apple will be reporting its earnings on Tuesday, followed by Microsoft’s Windows 10 hardware event in New York on Wednesday and possibly new Macs debuting on Thursday.On Tuesday, Apple shares closed down 0.07% at $117.47. Year to date, the stock is up more than 9%, while in the last year, it is up almost 6%.
