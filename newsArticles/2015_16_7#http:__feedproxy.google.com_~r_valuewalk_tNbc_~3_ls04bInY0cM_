The traditional SIM card may soon become obsolete. A new report indicates Apple and Samsung are in talks with GSMA to implement E-SIM card instead. Traditional SIM cards work with specific networks, but E-SIM cards would make it easier to switch networks. The one big change with the chips is that they are not accessible.GSM Association confirmed Apple and Samsung’s participation, but nothing is set in stone yet. The association remains positive Apple will sign a formal agreement soon. Apple previously introduced its own SIM chip with the iPad 2, so it is not surprising the Cupertino tech company is on board with the change. The tablet gives users a choice of three major carriers minus Verizon. The new E-SIM card is not expected to replace Apple’s SIM card just yet, it will likely ship with the iPhone 6S series.According to GSMA as told to by The Financial Times, “With the majority of operators on board, the plan is to finalise the technical architecture that will be used in the development of an end-to-end remote SIM solution for consumer devices, with delivery anticipated by 2016.”Phones with E-SIM cards could be a huge game changer as it gives people the chance to switch carriers with ease. It may also force carriers to reconsider lengthy contracts and hefty roaming charges.Apple continuously looks for new ways to expand options for customers. The company recently joined forces with GigSky to offer data plans for iPad users. The service expands to users in over 90 countries and territories. All users need is an Apple SIM and Gig Sky account to purchase temporary data plans for international travels. The plan pricing options vary by country.
