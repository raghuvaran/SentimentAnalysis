BlackBerry users were not included in the WhatsApp cutoff, at least for now. The messaging service announced early last year that it would end support by late 2016 on several mobile platforms, including BlackBerry 10 and BlackBerry OS, Nokia Symbian S60, Nokia S40, Windows Phone 7, Android 2.1 and Android 2.2, and iPhone 3GS/iOS 6.In a quiet update to that same announcement, WhatsApp confirmed that it will extend support for Nokia Symbian S60, Nokia S40, BlackBerry 10, and BB OS until June 30.Previously, the messaging service said that it needs to start focusing its efforts on the mobile platforms that the vast majority of people use instead of on all the small platforms that the messaging platform has supported since its release in 2009. WhatsApp said during its initial announcement that the aging platforms do not offer the kind of capabilities that it needs in order to deploy better features.So Nokia and BlackBerry users have been excluded from the initial cutoff date and will now get to use the messaging service for another six months. But any user with a device running on iOS 6 or iPhone 3GS, Android 2.1 and 2.2, and Windows Phone 7 will not be able to use WhatsApp any more.Many users, especially those using BlackBerry phones that are relatively new, have complained about the decision, which is probably why the messaging platform announced a change in its plans. BlackBerry fans even launched an online petition to fight the messaging giant. WhatsApp’s decision “is nonsense [sic] a lot of people still use the platform daily. I hope WhatsApp/Facebook sees [sic] this. At least give us the service with no updates,” the petition reads.Despite the extension, there will be many users who will be disappointed when the messaging service stops working. However, it is for greater good. Cutting services to older platforms will probably allow more rapid introduction of new features. Many are expected in 2017, including the ability to edit or entirely delete messages after they have been sent.
