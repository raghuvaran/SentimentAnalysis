iPhone jailbreak users, here’s some bad news for you. The TaiG jailbreak for iOS 8.4, iOS 8.3, iOS 8.2 and iOS 8.1.3 has been patched by Apple in its latest release of iOS, which is version 8.4.1. The Cupertino company, more than a month after releasing its iOS 8.4, has patched the TaiG jailbreak vulnerability with its new iOS 8.4.1, which means all the security holes that TaiG have found to jailbreak the iOS are no more.Apart from patching the jailbreak and making jailbreak users unhappy, the company has also underatken several other improvements and fixes to Apple Music. Here’s what the release note states:You can view a complete list of security content fixes here. It is worth noting that Apple has patched not one, but eight exploits used in TaiG jailbreak. Apple obviously stated everything in detail on the page, and also credited the Chinese based TaiG team for bringing its attention to these security exploits.CVE-2015-5746 : evad3rs, TaiG Jailbreak Team CVE-2015-5766 : TaiG Jailbreak Team CVE-2015-5752 : TaiG Jailbreak Team CVE-2015-3806 : TaiG Jailbreak Team CVE-2015-3803 : TaiG Jailbreak Team CVE-2015-3802 : TaiG Jailbreak Team CVE-2015-3805 : TaiG Jailbreak Team CVE-2015-5774 : TaiG Jailbreak TeamThis news means that if you update to iOS 8.4.1, then you will lose your jailbreak on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. Until and unless TaiG or another jailbreak team finds yet another exploit to enable a jailbreak, you’re out of luck. Right now, it is probably better to wait and watch the jailbreak scene rather than updating to this new version of iOS.If you are on older version of iOS, then you can update to iOS 8.4 now, but do not update to iOS 8.4.1. Apple is still signing iOS 8.4, which means you are still good to update to this version, but update quickly as we don’t know when the company will stop signing the older OS.
