Apple has officially unveiled two new computers: a new 15-inch MacBook Pro and 27-inch iMac with Retina display. Both devices feature Intel Core processors for speedier computing experiences.Highlights for the MacBook Pro include PCLe-flash storage and Force Touch Trackpad. The latter is a pressure sensitive trackpad that gives haptic feedback for an experience that feels similar to traditional trackpads. The appeal of Force Touch is that it does not need a lot of physical space.The high-end version of the MacBook Pro (which retails for $2,499) features an upgraded discrete graphics option. The cheaper version that retails for $1,999 also comes with Intel graphics.The iMac update comes with a 5K Retina display, which was expected considering that last year’s update had the same feature. It also features an AMD Radeon R9 M290 graphics card and a 3.3 GHz quad-core Intel Core i5 processor.  The less expensive option includes 1TB of standard HDD storage and 8GB of RAM. The more expensive version comes with a 1TB Fusion Drive, an AMD Radeon R9 M290X graphics card and a 3.5 GHz Intel Core i5 processor.Sales of Apple’s Mac computers were strong this past quarter, and the tech giant’s latest addition of Force Touch technology to the lineup may help boost overall MacBook sales. The addition could also start new possibilities if and when app developers incorporate the technologies into their own apps.The new 15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina starts at $1,299, and the 27-inch iMac with Retina 5K display starts at $1,999. Both computers offer decent battery life of up to nine hours. Base models ship as early as one day, and upgraded models generally start shipping in one to three business days.Apple’s recent Mac unveilings come just before the company’s highly anticipated Worldwide Developers’ Conference where the company is expected to introduce the next generations of the iOS and OS X operating systems.
