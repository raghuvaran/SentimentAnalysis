Apple has just got a new tag. Chinese billionaire Jia Yueting, who is currently worth $3.8 billion, says the Cupertino-based tech giant is like Adolf Hitler. For Yueting, it might have been a good way to garner attention, considering his Internet video site Leshi TV (LeTV) is planning to enter the smartphone market.On his verified Weibo page (via The Verge), which has over 5.5 million followers, Yueting posted an image teasing the upcoming launch of LeTV’s smartphone. The image compares Apple to Nazis. It shows a cartoon Adolf Hitler with a red armband that bears Apple logo instead of the Nazi Swastika. The text in the post compares the attributes of Android and iOS ecosystems:”Crowdsourced, freedom vs. arrogance, tyranny.”Yueting argued that the iPhone maker’s approach was hurting technological innovation and the interests of consumers. He said developers around the world “love yet hate” the iOS domination. Under the arrogant regime of iOS domination, he asked, “is this kind of innovation okay?” He added that Apple was a “dusk empire,” suggesting that it was dying.The image in Yueting’s post teases the company’s upcoming LeTV X900 smartphone. LeTV’s phone opens doors to freedom, while the sign right behind Hitler reads “Caution, do not cross.” Anyway, criticizing Apple is nothing new for rivals. Google recently took a dig at the iOS’ restrictive behavior in its new ad campaign for Android. But there is a huge difference between Google’s ad and Yueting’s approach to malign Apple.Rumors suggest that LeTV’s new phone will have a 5.5-inch display and 4GB RAM. Many Chinese smartphone vendors, including Xiaomi, blatantly copy Apple’s smartphone design and user interface. Xiaomi’s latest Mi4 handset resembles the iPhone 5 in design, and runs MIUI, which closely resembles the iOS 7 in terms of UI, simplicity and color.
