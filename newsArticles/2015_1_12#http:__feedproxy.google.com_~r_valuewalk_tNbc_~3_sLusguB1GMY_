The much-rumored iPhone 7 is unlikely to be unveiled until September 2016. But a bunch of rumors about the device have been doing rounds for months. Now a user on Chinese microblogging site Weibo (via G for Games) who has leaked accurate details about Apple’s plans in the past, has learned from sources that the Cupertino company is testing at least five different variants of the iPhone 7, each with different hardware characteristics.If true, the report suggests that Apple is still months away from finalizing the next-gen iPhone’s hardware design and characteristics. Testing different prototypes will help the company figure out what features would go best in the iPhone 7. Past rumors have claimed that the device would feature a dustproof and waterproof design.Sources in China said the prototypes being tested include wireless charging technology, USB Type-C port, dual camera configurations, multi-Force Touch, and the fingerprint scanner embedded in the display. The report added that Apple is also mulling the idea of replacing LCD panels with AMOLED display technology. However, recent rumors suggest that the iPhones are unlikely to get AMOLED displays before 2017.Incorporating fingerprint recognition technology within the display will allow Apple to eliminate the home button. It will let the company get rid of those extra-large top and bottom bezels. Users have been expecting wireless charging for years, but the tech giant is yet to implement the technology. The multi-touch 3D Touch might allow users to press harder with two fingers to bring up different options than what it serves when you press hard with one finger, reports 9to5Mac.Though the report shouldn’t be taken too seriously, it’s entirely possible that Apple is testing various iPhone 7 prototypes with these technologies. Last week, Japanese website Mac Otakara reported that the iPhone 7 will ditch the 3.5mm headphone jack in favor of a Lightning port to reduce the thickness of the phone by at least 1mm. The iPhone 7 is expected to be as thin as the latest iPod Touch.
