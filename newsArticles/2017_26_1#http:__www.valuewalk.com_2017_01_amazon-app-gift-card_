Amazon is offering a five dollar gift card for signing in to the Amazon App for the first time. This is another great deal which I just found sent to my inbox and was excited once again. For those who have not seen it Amazon’s amazing deal on the gift card and their incredible Credit Card offer are still available. Check those out soon if you want because the gift card offer expires soon. I believe with this deal my Amazon free credit is now up to about $90 on $100 spent (see the math here) that is better than Warren Buffett even in his early days! Follow the directions below or type in https://.amazon.com/underground on your smartphone. I already updated the Amazon app and the credit is on its way. It took one minute!Note this deal expires soon, as well!
