Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock is too low, believes CNBC host Jim Cramer, who says the benefit of users switching from Samsung to Apple is not reflected in the stock price as yet.“I think the phone remains supply-constrained … and therefore the stock is too low,” the Mad Money host said.Cramer is convinced that the market has risen on real strength and not because investors are covering short positions. He arrived at this conclusion after he noticed a rare combination of events that took place in the stock market, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was the first sign of strength that he saw, reports CNBC.“When you can find companies that could be conceptually undervalued and their stocks run on that, even when they were already expensive on an earnings basis, then you have a powerful thrust that sends us higher even before anyone has time to ring the register,” the expert said.Also Cramer said Thursday that if Salesforce called off the talks to acquire Twitter, it had nothing to do with Twitter itself. Instead, he believes it was related to LinkedIn.Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock gained yesterday after German supplier Dialog Semiconductor said its quarterly revenue was higher than expected.
