Apple’s holiday return policy is in full swing as people are busy shopping for Christmas. Under the policy, all Apple products purchased between Nov. 1 and Dec. 25 will be accepted for returns at Apple Stores or through mail until Jan. 8, says a report from MacRumors.People who purchased Apple products on Black Friday will have a time period of a little more than one month to return Apple products, while those in Germany, Sweden and the U.K. will have until Jan. 20. The standard return policy at the iPhone firm is 14 days.Not all Apple products are eligible for return. There is a list of ineligible items that should be looked at before heading to stores for return. Staple products are eligible for a return, including the iMac, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV and Macs, while Gift Cards are not eligible.For a successful return, it is very important that all the items that came along in the original packaging are returned, and this includes the instruction manual as well. While returning, customers should ensure that accessories such as headphones, charging cables, etc., are there in the box, the report says.For customers who made online purchases, the return process is different as they will be required to contact the company first to schedule pickup or will have to reach a retail store with the device. The last day customers can return an Apple product is mentioned on the receipt, and it is there on emailed receipts as well.If the product has been bought from other retailers such as Target, Best Buy or Walmart, then their specific return policy will have to be followed and not Apple’s.As per Walmart’s return policy, items bought from the electronics department between Nov. 1 and Dec. 25 will have to be returned by Jan. 10, and if the receipt is missing, then the refund will be put on a Walmart Gift card.At Target, the general return policy is 90 days, but it is possible for different products to have different return dates. Target’s holiday season lasts from Nov. 1 to Dec. 25, and a 30-day return window could be applicable to electronics purchased during that time. Best Buy requires products purchased between Nov. 1 and Dec. 31 to be returned by Jan. 15, the report says.
