Apple’ AirPods do not have those long cords that can annoy you when they tangle, but the wireless headphones may keep you in constant fear that you will lose them and will have to pay $69 to replace one. So to rid you of that fear, the tech giant has come up with a new feature to help you find them.On Tuesday, the Cupertino-based company announced a feature that uses the earphones’ wireless tech to track their whereabouts when you misplace them. The feature is integrated into the app dubbed “Find My iPhone” in iOS 10.3. It is reaching software developers on Tuesday and will soon be available publicly, according to The Wall Street Journal.There is no built-in GPS connection due to battery constraints and the small size of the AirPods, so you cannot even remotely pinpoint their exact whereabouts. Therefore, the tech giant is depending on your iPad or iPhone to overcome this shortcoming. You just have to tap “Play Sound” in the iOS app, and the AirPods will begin chirping.Based on explanations from the tech giant, the WSJ report has listed three common scenario in which the “Find My AirPods” feature could come in handy;Apart from the AirPods, the Cupertino-based company also plans to add a new feature to the Apple Watch. The company plans to add a Theater Mode to the watch in the upcoming watchOS 3.2 update. Theater Mode allows users to mute sound and disables waking the screen when raising your wrist, according to Apple’s developer guide.Notifications with haptic feedback will still come on the watch, which can be viewed by tapping the screen or pressing the digital crown. SiriKit will also be added in watchOS 3.2, and it will work the same way it does on the iPhone.
