Police in the United Kingdom have released photos of the green iPhone 5C which they say saved a man’s life after he was shot.The iPhone 5C absorbed a blast from a sawn-off shotgun which was fired from close range. The 25-year-old victim approached a group of youths outside his apartment building, where they had cut off the water supply. During the ensuing confrontation one of teenagers shot the man.Ryan Duggan, 19, has been found guilty of attempted murder and possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life. Sentencing is due on July 10. Duggan was part of the group which had cut off the water supply to the building, and the victim chased him following a verbal altercation. Duggan then pulled out the weapon and shot the man from close range.The shot to the abdomen could have been lethal, but the iPhone 5C appears to have absorbed most of the blast from its position inside the victim’s pocket. Detective Inspector Gary McIntyre from Cheshire Police claimed that the smartphone had saved the man from dying.If the phone had not been in his pocket “he would have undoubtedly died,” said McIntyre.Police made a thorough search of the area and found the weapon hidden in a bush with the used cartridge still inside. Duggan was later traced to an apartment and arrested. Although the victim has suffered greatly due to the shooting, he is lucky that the iPhone 5C absorbed most of the impact.“Despite making good progress he still requires treatment for his injuries – including further operations and rehabilitation. The nightmare is far from over,” said McIntyre.This is not the first time that an iPhone has reportedly saved someone’s life. Last year a U.S. soldier said that his smartphone had prevented his artery from severing following a suicide bomber attack.Nokia handsets have also been credited with saving the lives of two men. One man had fallen down a mountainside in Taiwan, and was rescued by authorities thanks to the durability and battery life of his Nokia, while another man shielded his head from a collapsing wall using his Nokia Lumia 920.Source: ITV News
