We’re nearly at the end of the first quarter of 2017, and going by the biggest tech events so far – CES and MWC – this will be a great year for technology as some New Gadgets are unveiled.Although many of the devices we’re excited about have yet to hit the shelves, we know they’re around the corner. Samsung’s next flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S8, is only about a month away, Apple is looking to unveil its newest batch of iPads by the end of Spring, and Dell has just reintroduced it’s overly successful XPS 13, now with convertible-hybrid capabilities. And, let’s not forget the iPhone 8, which, according to reports, is set to be the boldest iPhone ever made.However, while these are some of the most anticipated releases this year, they’re only the tip of the iceberg. In addition to the mainstream companies, many lesser-known manufacturers are gearing up to unveil some pretty remarkable innovations.The gadgets below may not be trending online, but they’re outstanding nonetheless.The newest release from PowerVision is not for everyone, but those of us that are interested in maritime exploration will be thoroughly impressed.The PowerRay is an ingenious piece of technology that aims to revolutionize today’s recreational fishing experience. It can dive as deep as 98 feet underwater, and detect fish up to 131 feet below it, which pushes the total diving depth up to 230 feet.The most groundbreaking feature of the PowerRay, however, is an add-on component that PowerVision calls the Fishfinder. With the Fishfinder, the PowerRay can use sonar to detect marine life with precision and send data, such as images, real-time 4K video, and underwater landscape information to an explorer’s Android or iOS smartphone through Wi-Fi.The Fishfinder add-on is easy to install and can be detached for use as a standalone fish finding device. And as if that’s not enough, it also includes a blue light, that flashes to lure fish.For users who would want an immersive experience, the PowerRay supports an optional PowerVision VR Goggle, which provides a thrilling underwater view with virtual reality technology. With gesture recognition capabilities, you can interact with the robot under water by tilting your head to trigger left and right, and up and down turns.Recreational fishing has only seen small innovations in the past, but this year, PowerVision is taking it to a whole new level. The PowerRay is a fun and efficient fishing and exploration tool to enthusiasts and hobbyists all around the world.The idea of a robot nanny won’t tickle the nerves of many parents, but with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, an HD camera and wheels that can traverse any surface, Kuri has a lot to impress.Created by the Bosch-incubated startup Mayfield Robotics, the robot’s adorable looks, and wordless chirps and nods make it appealing to the younger members of the family while helping a parent keep an eye and ear on every inch of the house.Kuri can check on your kids and pets when you’re away, and use its Wi-Fi connection to send alerts directly to your phone. It successfully navigates from room to room, and once you guide it using the remote control in the app, it remembers where the rooms are.Moreover, the gadget’s voice recognition allows you to issue voice commands through the app to direct the robot to record a video or go into a room, as well as speak through it to your children or pets. And to avoid hitting objects or falling over edges, Kuri comes with a set of 360-degree sensors, with which it intelligently maps its environment.Everything about the robot nanny sounds cool but, on the flip side, it won’t be available for purchase until December. And when it does, it’ll cost a whopping $700. You can, however, pre-order the robot for a $100 deposit.If you’re a gamer with cash to burn, Acer has a fascinating and somewhat ludicrous product that will help you do just that. We’ve seen brilliant gaming laptops before, but the Predator 21 X is, quite frankly, out of this world.In addition to being the first laptop with a curved 21-inch QHD display, the rig itself is more powerful than your average future-proof VR-ready gaming desktop. Its insane hardware set includes Intel’s high-performance Core i7-7820HK processor, 64GB DDR4-2400 RAM, four 512GD SSDs, and to top it all, dual NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 GPUs.The crazy doesn’t end there, as Acer has fitted a mechanical keyboard with Cherry MX Brown switches and RGB backlighting under each key. The touchpad can be flipped to double as a numerical keypad, and on the left-hand side is an array of programmable keys that can be used for special commands in-game. Above the keyboard is a triangular window that shows off one of the Predator’s three cooling fans, to give a gamer the visual satisfaction that comes with getting a desktop PC.Weighing 19.4 pounds, the Predator 21 X is, by far, the heaviest gaming laptop around, and with an exorbitant $9,000 price tag, it’s as expensive as a laptop can get. Nevertheless, Acer has gone where none has been before, to pull off an incredible feat of technology.Are you going as crazy about virtual reality as the rest of the world? Well, to propel the technology even further is an exoskeleton that promises a breathtaking whole-body VR experience in the comfort of your home.The Hypersuit, one of the coolest products unveiled at CES 2017 in January, is a full-body immersive simulator that combines a movable exoskeleton platform with a VR headset, like the HTC Vive or the Oculus Rift, to allow the wearer to control movement using arm gestures.If your arm moves to the left, your body will follow the same direction in the virtual setting. This means that, depending on what you’re viewing or playing, you can become a flying superhero, an intergalactic traveler or a deep-sea diver. It also comes with a fan that can automatically adjust its wind-speed depending on the activity.Built by a Paris-based French startup, the Hypersuit is currently intended for entertainment and gaming. The firm, however, says that it could one day be used for physical therapy or military training.The suit will start shipping in June, and although no definite price has been set yet, we can safely assume it won’t be cheap. Regardless, it’s an impressive product that’s guaranteed to please every virtual reality enthusiast.While nearly all the companies we know and love have one or two releases in the pipeline, little-known gadgets like the ones above have essential parts to play in making 2017 the innovative year it will be.Vigilance Chari is a freelance writer from LapopNinja covering tech news and gadgets.
