Apple is well known for its secrecy; especially where its future plans regarding software and the hardware that runs it is concerned. So with WWDC 2016 coming up fast in June, the web is alive with rumors about iOS 10, iPhone 7 and the new iPad Pro. And that’s because the WWDC has always been seen as the place where many of Apple’s advancements have come from. And WWDC 2016 seems to be one of the most highly anticipated for years!In previous years Apple’s WWDC has been the forum that has showcased many incremental advancements and for that reason it has always been the best place for many an Apple fan to keep his / her ear to the ground about.It’s mainly thanks to the developers at the WWDC, that the iPhone has seen such major advancement over the last few years. For example, the iPhone 3GS was launched with what looked like a very much cheaper design than the original, which was done to bring down costs and make it affordable. However, inside the handset were many major improvements. These improvements ranged from an application processor chip to its camera and support for 3G and GPS.All in all, the WWDC has been a driver of huge technological growth for Apple, not only for the iPhone, but also for the likes of the iPad and iPod. But, let’s move on and find out what does WWDC 2016 have in store for us?It’s not expected that we will hear all about the iPhone 7 at next month’s meeting. I would expect its headline features and other details to be released in September. However, one thing I already know is that a new version of iOS is generally always debuted in June at the WWDC. In the past this has paved the way for new features to be included in the upcoming new iPhone model.However, we won’t know anything for certain until the actual release, so here’s an outline of what Apple is likely, or is most definitely considering.It’s already possible that you may have seen a few of the rumors doing the rounds about Apple music. These rumors are suggesting it could be the recipient of targeted enhancements. These enhancements would add 3D Touch support for previews, enhance content search and better expose lyrics.In the past Apple has been seen to be not as serious as it should be, where social media stickiness is concerned for Apple Music. However, if Apple at this year’s WWDC does intend to prove it is serious, this could be done by expanding its connect service, so it is not a clumsy way to follow artists. This could also add the ability for Apple’s large amount of Music subscribers to swap things like mix tape playlists, or even let other users follow them.It seems that everyone who can is working on bot-like assistants that help to provide access too many different services. One example of this is from China, where the WeChat app allows its users to not only communicate with each other, but also buy goods and other services.To do this, all of the companies involved need to run requests for their services through the messaging app, this is because they lack the basic control over the device platform to integrate these services into. Another example of this would be Facebook, it has continued to not be able to launch its own smartphone, and then again failed to layer Facebook Home on top of Android phones back in 2013.So where would this lead Apple? Well, it is possible that at this year’s WWDC we may see the ability to text Siri launch. This would expend greatly increase the usefulness of the virtual assistant. So basically this would mean that, if Siri can’t understand what you’re saying and find reasonable results. A user could text the personal assistant and have Siri recognize the search or command that way.Often overlooked, but just as possible to see at the WWDC is Apple’s idea to greatly enhance Maps related searches. This could be done by either intelligently limiting searches to more local results, or by manually adding a UI element that could do it. I’ve often seen a search return non specific results related to my local area and often the results have been from across the world.Whoever looks after Maps on iOS should be made to regularly use this software until it actually delivers search results that provide what a user wants.iOS 10 will more than likely be the version of iOS that builds the additional features required by the devices it runs on. Whilst too many iOS has always been a stable and well designed OS in the eyes of users from across the world it has been steadily falling behind Android over the last few years.So with that in mind, I’m hoping that this year’s WWDC will bring with it some serious improvements!What would you like to see in iOS 10?
