Google has updated its Google Maps Local Guides program to reward people with increased Google Drive storage and early access to new products. People who regularly leave reviews, upload photos, or add information related to restaurants, tourist spots and other locations are eligible for these rewards.Google will offer early access to its new products and features to guides who reach level two, while participants in level three will get a badge next to their names indicating that a review or piece of information has come from a trusted guide.Google has reserved the most appealing prize for level four participants. Local guides who reach that rank will be eligible for 1 TB of drive storage, which usually costs $9.99 a month, for free. Microsoft recently made rollbacks on its OneDrive storage, so this offer from Google comes as a good opportunity for getting a terabyte of cloud space for free.A person will need to accumulate 500 points to be able to ascend all the way to level five, after which they become eligible to apply to attend the first Local guides summit in 2016. No concrete details about the summit are available yet, but the Internet firm says the person chosen as an attendee will get the opportunity to “meet other top Guides from around the world, explore the Google campus, and get the latest info about Google Maps.”Google intends to fill Google Maps with more relevant information, and for this it has been slowly expanding its Local Guides program over the past year. In August, the company tested a new feature that detects food photos taken at restaurants and automatically uploads them. It also attaches them to the location where they were taken so that other users could get an idea of what they could get to eat at a particular restaurant.Google Maps has been seen as the leader in the mapping market. After Apple Maps’ shaky launch, the iPhone firm has stepped up the development of its products and recently added public transport directions. It also plans to introduce its own take on Google’s Street View. But by adding real-world rewards for Local Guides and extending Google Maps, the internet firm has made its offering a much more appealing concept.
