The Apple Watch prices have been declining consistently for the last few weeks ahead of the official unveiling of the new Apple Watch 2 next month. Though the new Watch is said to retain the screen sizes of 38mm and 42mm, there would be several improvements such as a new display technology and superior waterproofing. A newly leaked image suggests that the Apple Watch 2 will also pack a bigger battery, addressing one of the biggest user complaints.According to a leaked image posted on the Chinese microblogging site Weibo, the 42mm Apple Watch 2 will feature a 334 lithium-ion battery. It is 35.7% bigger than the 246mAh battery used in the current 42mm Apple Watch. However, the leaked image does not reveal anything about the 38mm Apple Watch 2 battery. The authenticity of the image could not be confirmed, but the upcoming Apple Watch has been rumored to get a much-needed battery upgrade.The current Apple Watch promises a battery life of up to 18 hours with mixed usage. A bigger battery pack inside the Apple Watch 2 should enhance its battery life. There are a few competing smartwatches have batteries that last several days. Apple is expected to launch its next-gen wearable device alongside the new iPhone 7 next month.KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo recently said in a research note that the Apple Watch 2 will pack a faster TSMC-built processor, better waterproofing, GPS, and barometer, besides the larger battery. However, it won’t have cellular connectivity. Apple has been trying to clear the current inventory before the new Watch hits the store shelves. The Apple Watch is currently selling for just $199 at Best Buy.The reason the new Watch will not include cellular connectivity is that it would consume a lot of battery power. The cellular would take up power and space, and the wearable device is already short of both. It crams a lot of features and components in a tiny package.
