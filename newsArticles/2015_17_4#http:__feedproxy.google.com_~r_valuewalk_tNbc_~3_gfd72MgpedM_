Apple may have to make some changes to its iPhone 7 production plans due to solid demand for Samsung’s recently released Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge. Samsung said earlier this week that demand for its new phones was beyond expectations. So, Apple may have to seek the help of an additional chip manufacturer for its next iPhone, reports TechRadar. The Cupertino company had reportedly signed deals with Samsung and GlobalFoundries to supply the A9 processor for the iPhone 7. Notably, GlobalFoundries also supplies processor for Samsung’s Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge. Strong demand for Samsung’s phones will keep GlobalFoundries extra busy. So, the manufacturer will reportedly find it difficult to meet Apple’s supply demands.KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that the iPhone maker has now turned to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co to supply a major chunk of A9 processor. The Cupertino company has worked with TSMC in the past, so the relationship is unlikely to be a bumpy one.Last year’s iPhone 6 Plus received a lot of negative publicity due to the ‘bendgate’ controversy. But the upcoming iPhone 7 and 7 Plus won’t be a victim of bendgate. Taiwan’s Economic Daily News has learned from supply chain sources that Apple will use the Series 7000 aluminum alloy for the iPhone 7 body. It’s the same material used in the Apple Watch Sport.The Series 7000 aluminum is much stronger than the material used in the existing iPhone models, reports the Economic Daily News. To be precise, it is 60% stronger than the material used in the iPhone 6, but has only one-third the density of stainless steel, making it lighter. It is the same material used for competition bikes.The Series 7000 alloy will also make the iPhone 7 scratch-resistant. Supply chain sources said that the next iPhone may also feature zirconia beads that give Apple Watch Sport a smooth and uniform finish. Previously, there were rumors that the Cupertino company would unveil the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus this year. But KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo shot down those rumors by saying that Apple will launch the iPhone 7 this year.The iPhone 7 is expected to feature a DSLR-quality camera, Force Touch technology, light field imaging, iOS 9 software and A9 processor.
