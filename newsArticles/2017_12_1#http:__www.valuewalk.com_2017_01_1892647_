Apple has seen all the glory it will have and is nearing its downfall, believes one venture capitalist and Facebook board member. In an interview on Wednesday, Peter Thiel prognosticated that the “age of Apple” is at its end assmartphone evolution has reached a zenith.The New York Times segment “Confirm or Deny” published Thiel’s bleak view of Apple’s allegedly imminent downfall. The show’s format is a quick-fire Q&A session in which headline makers are asked about their views on a variety of current topics, and they deliver hot takes on them.Upon being asked if the age of Apple is over, Thiel replied, “Confirm. We know what a smartphone looks like and does. It’s not the fault of Tim Cook, but it’s not an area where there will be any more innovation.”Thiel’s statement implies that Apple’s impact on society, its future and its ability to facilitate change is reliant on the iPhone. There are several reasons supporting Thiel’s view, notes AppelInsider.The now 10-year-old iPhone connected many devices to the internet, such as the phone and iPod. It changed how personal electronics are viewed and became the de facto standard for all smartphones. Apple achieved unprecedented financial success because of its ability to disrupt personal communications.For nearly ten years in continuity, iPhone sales were growing, but last April, it saw its first year-over-year contraction. There was a time when customers looked up to Apple because of its ability to lift spirits, but it is unable to do so anymore and many people are complaining about it.Thiel had negative opinions about other companies as well, so Apple does not need to worry much.When he was asked if the Obama administration gave too much power to Google, he said, “Confirm. Google had more power under Obama than Exxon had under Bush 43.”Unsurprisingly, he had positive things to say about Facebook and stated that people should trust the social networking company.“Although, trusting in what way? There are a comical number of misguided conspiracy theories about Facebook,” Thiel said.On being asked if there is a similarity between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Donald Trump, Thiel said, “I’m going to get in trouble, but they are, actually. They’re both grandmaster-level salespeople and these very much larger-than-life figures.”Thiel and Musk have known each other since their PayPal days.
