Apple is planning an event in March for the launching of the Apple Watch 2 and perhaps a 4-inch iPhone 6c, according to 9to5Mac based on information from sources familiar with the matter.There is a possibility for the tech giant to start selling the second generation smartwatch in April— almost one year after the first model went on sale, according to the report.Media outlet previously reported that the tech giant had been developing technologies for the Apple Watch 2 even before it started shipping the first generation smartwatch.Some of the different features Apple has been working on for the Apple Watch 2 include a new camera, wireless and health sensor technologies including sleep tracking. The new features that will be integrated into the second generation smartwatch are still unknown. There were reports that the Apple Watch 2 will have a larger battery. It will also have more face and strap selections.Apple released new colors, bands, and software features for the Apple Watch in September.The report also indicated that Apple is working on a new iPhone 6c equipped with a 4-inch display. The tech giant is expected to continue producing iPhones with 4-inch displays since some of its users prefer a smaller screen than the 4.7 inch iPhone 6S and 5.5-inch iPhone 6S Plus.The specifications of the 4-inch iPhone 6c are expected to fall between the iPhone 5S and iPhone 6S. There are speculations that the device will sport the camera features of the earlier iPhone, and it will be powered by the new A9 chip.The Apple Watch 2 and the 4-inch iPhone 6C will be coming out (if the March event is true) following the launching of the iPad Pro. CNBC noted the observation of some analysts that the tech giant failed to drive sufficient enthusiasm for its other products outside the iPhone.If Apple is indeed planning to launch the Apple Watch 2 and the 4-inch iPhone 6c in March next year, it would be the third time for the company to introduce its products in the same month. It appears that the company is changing its schedule for its major events. Take note that Apple normally launches its products in the second half of each calendar year.During its March event last year, Apple introduced that 12-inch MacBook, and the ResearchKit iPhone framework. The company also unveiled they finalized version of the Apple Watch. In March 2012, Apple launched that first iPad with a Retina display.
