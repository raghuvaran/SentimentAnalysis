Apple’s Pencil and keyboard for the iPad were not favored by many when they were launched. Many mocked the stylus for the iPad Pro and keyboard that looks and works like the one the Microsoft makes for its Surface tablets. But now both are selling good and are in short supply, says a report from CNN Money.Both products are reselling on eBay for as much as $500. Apple unveiled the new products in September, and both went on sale last week Wednesday. On Apple’s online store, the stock sold out very quickly, and now there is a wait of four to five weeks.According to blogs on Reddit and Twitter, the products are so popular that people are even stealing the Pencil from demo stations in stores. There have been no comments from the  company about the theft reports. Speaking to CNN Money, an Apple spokesman said, “We have a limited supply of Apple Pencil and the Smart Keyboard in Apple Retail stores. Customers are very excited for iPad Pro, Apple Pencil and the Smart Keyboard.”Calling the shortage “an embarrassing damper on the Pro launch,” Tumblr cofounder Marco Arment tweeted, “My Apple Store got 20 Pencils yesterday. They let one guy buy all 20. Meanwhile, no in-store pickup, and online backordered 4-5 weeks.”Arment further said the good news is that the stock is coming to stores in quantity, thus, scalpers on eBay now have a limited time to make profits.On Apple’s website, the Pencil is listed at $99, but on eBay, it is selling for as much as $500. The same is the case for the Smart Keyboard, which costs $169 retail, but on eBay, it is selling for between $200 and $650. Though the Smart Keyboard is out of stock, buyers can still purchase a Logitech model available in Apple stores. But shipments for the Logitech version are showing one to two weeks, as per Apple’s website.Many were shocked when the iPhone firm unveiled the new Apple Pencil stylus. Steve Jobs was known to hate styluses. Among the first things he did when he went back to the company in 1997 was to scrap the Newton, which was a tablet-like device with a stylus.
