Apple’s much-awaited iPhone 6S and 6S Plus have entered mass production. The devices are expected to hit the stores in September. Apple’s partners are readying 85 million to 90 million units of the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus to meet the potential demand. And now Buzzfeed News has learned from inside sources that Apple will hold the iPhone 6S launch event in the week of September 7, most likely on Wednesday, September 9.Notably, September 9 is the same say Apple had launched its current flagship iPhone 6 last year. The Cupertino-based tech giant has traditionally unveiled its flagship iPhones on Tuesday. It’s still unclear why Apple would want to move the event to Wednesday this year. Anyway, the report adds that Apple will also unveil its much-rumored 12.9-inch iPad Pro at the same event.Sources told Buzzfeed News that the tech giant would also debut the successor to Apple TV at the September 9 event. The revamped set-top box was initially expected to be unveiled at the WWDC in June, but the company scrapped that plan just a few weeks before its annual event. The new Apple TV is rumored to get a “drastically improved” remote with touchpad input, a slimmer chassis, a higher built-in storage, and an OS that supports Siri.The features and specifications of iPhone 6S and 6S Plus have emerged in the past few months, thanks to a series of leaks. The new models will have the same 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screen size, but there will be significant under the hood changes. The new devices will boast of Force Touch technology that debuted with Apple Watch. Apple has been putting a lot of emphasis on build quality to avoid a bendgate-like scenario. The company will reportedly use a sturdier Series 7000 aluminum, which is 60% more durable than the material used in the iPhone 6.Preliminary leaks suggest that the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus will get a major camera upgrade. The devices will feature 12-megapixel rear camera with 4K video recording and optical image stabilization. The front camera will have a flash for better selfies in low-light conditions. Other features include 2GB RAM, A9 processor, and a more efficient Qualcomm LTE modem.
