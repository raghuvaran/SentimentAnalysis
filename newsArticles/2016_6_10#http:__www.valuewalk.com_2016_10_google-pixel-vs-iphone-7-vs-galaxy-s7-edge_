At an event in San Fransico on Tuesday, two new Google Pixel smartphones were announced. Seen as a move away from its Nexus handsets, Google sees these new devices as perfect for Android purists. As such, it feels that it can take on the current crop of flagships from Apple and Samsung. So in this article, I will compare the smaller Pixel to the iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 Edge.The prices I am going to quote here are non-contract, meaning that they are for SIM-free unlocked handsets.For the 32GB iPhone 7, you will have to pay $649. You will have to add $100 to that if you want the Jet Black model, and if the low storage capacity doesn’t work for you, there is the 128GB for $749 and 256GB for $849. Just remember to add the $100 for each option if you want the expensive color.The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge tends to vary in price depending on where you buy it from. For example, Verizon has the 32GB variant on sale for $792, and AT&T has it for $749.99 with a $20 connection fee.The Google Pixel is firmly within the same price range of the current crop of flagships, meaning that for 32GB of storage, you’ll pay $769, which is $120 more than the iPhone 7. For the 128GB variant, you will pay $869, which is $120 more than the 256GB iPhone 7.Compared to the iPhone 7 with its 4.7-inch display, the Google Pixel is big. At 5 inches, the display on this Android handset is full-HD with a resolution of 1080×1920 and 441ppi. The iPhone 7 has a 4.7-inch LCD-display with a resolution of 750×1334 pixels and 326ppi.In comparison, the screen found on the Galaxy S7 Edge is a behemoth. At 5.5 inches, its resolution dwarfs that of the other two at 1440×2560, and with 534ppi, this puts it in an entirely different weight class than the Google Pixel and iPhone 7.Whenever I compare processors, I am always aware that not all companies or even benchmark tests adhere to the same standards. Also the fact that I’m comparing two Android handsets to an iOS handset which uses different technologies means it is difficult.Starting with the S7 Edge, depending on where you live, it will come with one of two processors, either the Snapdragon 820 running at 2×2.15 Ghz or the octa-core Exynos 8890 running at 4×2.3 Ghz. As for RAM, no matter where you are, 4G comes standard.The iPhone 7 uses the quad-core Apple A10 Fusion chip, which the company suggests is the most powerful chip ever placed into a smartphone. Whether that is the case is yet to be determined, but you can see how the iPhone 7 compares to its predecessor, the iPhone 6s. Concerning RAM, the standard 7, unlike the 7 Plus, offers a barely passable 2GB.The Google Pixel features the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chip running at 2×2.15 Ghz & 2×1.6 Ghz Kryo. In terms of RAM, it is directly comparable to the S7 Edge with 4GB. However, its smaller screen size and better CPU should give it an edge over the Edge.Much like Apple has with the iPhone 7 camera, Google has marketed the camera on its Pixel as the best smartphone camera available. However, unlike Apple, Google came armed with some speculative evidence at Tuesday’s launch event.Apparently the benchmarking site DxOMark managed to get its hands on a Google Pixel before launch, and according to the results, compared to other flagships, it came out on top, with a score of 89. That is the highest score ever achieved by a camera on a phone. That means it scored higher than both the iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 Edge.The Google Pixel’s camera has a 12.3-megapixel rear sensor with an f/2.0 aperture. It also features OIS, a dual-LED tone flash, and more excitingly, HDR+, which supposedly give the camera zero shutter lag. Lastly, there’s an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, which is ideal for the odd selfie.The iPhone 7 continues the current trend of 12-megapixel rear sensors, but it has a larger f/1.8 aperture. It also has optical image stabilization, the first time on an iPhone. There’s also a quad-LED True Tone flash and HDR. The front camera is 7 megapixels with face detection, HDR and panorama capabilities.Next, we have the Galaxy S7 Edge camera, which again has a 12-megapixel sensor. However, it has the better performing aperture at f/1.7, meaning it performs better in low-light conditions. Feature-wise, there’s phase detection, auto-focus, an LED flash, and OIS. The front camera has a 5-megapixel sensor and benefits from auto HDR and dual video call features.As for which has the better camera, I think it’s difficult to tell when doing on-paper reviews. However, having used the Galaxy S7 Edge, I can say that the other two have a lot to do to beat it.As usual, the latest handset from Apple has yet again fallen behind the ever-improving Android handsets in the battery stakes. The iPhone 7 features a miserly 1,960mAh battery, while the Google Pixel tops that with a 2,770mAh offering. However, it’s the Galaxy S7 Edge that comes out on top, with its 3,600mAh battery.Unfortunately, the batteries in all three are non-removable, and it’s only Samsung Android handsets that benefit from fast charging.While companies like LG and HTC have tried to take on Apple and Samsung, they have for the most part failed, and the two big behemoths of the tech world still reign supreme. However, with the announcement of the Google Pixel, we at last could have a new contender, something that could challenge the dominance of the big two.However, right now, it’s too early to say which handset comes out on top, as on-paper reviews never manage to tell the full story.
