The Apple TV has been available for preorder since Monday morning, but the company did not inform fans when to expect the device to become available for purchase at Apple Stores. But a few employees at Apple retail informed 9to5 Mac that the much-awaited set-top box will reach stores on Oct. 30.It is expected that by the end of this week, shipments will reach Apple retail locations, and the company will reconfigure stores overnight to bring their new product to the focus of promotions. Preorder customers who chose one-day shipping will reportedly start receiving their Apple TV beginning Friday.Preorders for the new Apple TV can also be placed with Best Buy, but in-store pickups aren’t available until after Nov. 4. Apple’s new set-top box is available in two configurations – a 32GB model priced at $149 and a 64GB box priced at $199.
