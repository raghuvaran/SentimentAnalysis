Best Buy will be the first major third-party national retailer for the smartwatch in the U.S.Jason Bonfig, a senior manager at Best Buy, said, “We are excited to bring the Apple Watch to more consumers, especially with the holidays coming up.” The watch will also be a valuable addition to Best Buy’s list of wearables, an emerging product category. From August, customers will be able to get the Apple Watch from over 100 Best Buy stores and from BestBuy.com, while 200 more will be added during the holiday shopping time, the retailer informed shoppers.The Apple Watch Sport model and other exclusive stainless steel models will be available at Best Buy stores, while the $10,000-plus gold version won’t be available there. Best Buy will be offering 16 models of the Apple Watch, including the Sports and Watch model, in both 38mm & 42mm. Besides the watch, the retailer will also be offering around 50 accessories, including bands, screen shields, stands and chargers.Best Buy is not the first third-party partner for Apple Watch, as the device is already available in select department stores and boutiques around the world.The tech giant started shipping the watch on April 24 in the U.S. and eight other countries, while seven more countries were added to the list on June 26. Despite the devicce’s initial success, analysts are uncertain about the longer-term success of the gadget.For the latest quarter, Apple announced a $10.7 billion profit on $49.6 billion in revenue, which was much greater than the $7.7 billion in profits on $37.4 billion in revenue in the same quarter last year. The exact sales figures of the watch were not known as Apple didn’t provide detail on “other products’” sales, which included the iPod, Apple TV, Beats headphones, accessories and the Apple Watch.However, on being asked, Apple CEO Tim Cook said during the earnings conference call that sales of the smartwatch had exceeded internal expectations. Although the preorder process started on April 10 in nine countries, the initial demand exceeded the initial supply. Highlighting demand for the watch, Cook said the company delayed its availability in its own retail stores to meet the first orders. Now a tie-up with Best Buy suggests the supply position is easing and that the company is exploring ways to pump up sales.
