Google’s Senior Vice President of hardware, Rick Osterloh attended Mobile World Congress last week and confirmed what everyone wanted to hear! There will indeed be a Google Pixel 2, and it will be released at some point later this year. Here’s what you need to know…While the head man of Google’s hardware division revealed that the handset is indeed under development. He did not say when the handset would hit the market, not did he say if the same partner was being used for production. In fact, other than confirming its existence and it coming in 2017 little else was revealed.Now, if you’re a Google handset fan wanting the brand to go in a similar direction as the Nexus line and offer affordable devices. You’re going to be disappointed, as Osterloh indicated the Pixel line, including the Google Pixel 2 would remain premium handsets.Sticking with a 2017 release date Osterloh may have inadvertently given us a clue to the month of release when he said:“There is an annual rhythm in the industry. So, you can count on us to follow it.” “You can count on a successor this year, even if you don’t hear a date from me now.”So, if the above is correct, it’s possible that another late in the year release is possible, why? Because the Pixel and Pixel XL were both launched in October 2016. Which means if a 12-month release cycle is to be adhered to we should expect the Google Pixel 2 in the same month.Just as 2016’s devices were the first to run on Android Nougat. It is thought that the Google Pixel 2 will be the first to use 8.0 Oreo. This version is yet to be confirmed by the mobile/search giant; however, there are plenty of rumors doing the rounds.While Osterloh failed to reveal any specification for the Pixel 2 rumors are already rife about what may be included inside the device. One such rumor suggests Google is working with the likes of Qualcomm to decide upon a CPU. Additionally, there could be an inclusion of technology from Intel this year. However, this is being called Specialized, and there is no detail.As for what we can expect, 2016 saw the two Pixel devices break onto the market quickly matching other Flagships. For 2017, the next device is expected to receive many improvements which include more storage, RAM, and improved chipset.There’s no doubt about it Google is on to a winner with its Pixel line, however, with their success came some harsh lessons. Lessons, which many retailers, carriers, and consumers hope Google will get to grips with this year.Extended periods of handset shortages have become the norm for the Pixel’s so far, and Google should concentrate on this if its next device is to compete with 2017’s flagship smartphones.As always we will keep you updated with the rumors and official news we hear prior to launch. In the meantime, let us know what you want/expect from the Google Pixel 2?
