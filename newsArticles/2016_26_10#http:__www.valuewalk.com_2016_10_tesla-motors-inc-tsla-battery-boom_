Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) The Battery Series is a five-part infographic series that explores what investors need to know about modern battery technology, including raw material supply, demand, and future applications.Presented by: Nevada Energy Metals, eCobalt Solutions Inc., and Great Lakes GraphiteWe’ve already looked at the evolution of battery technology and how lithium-ion technology will dominate battery market share over the coming years. Part 4 of the Battery Series breaks down the raw materials that will be needed for this battery boom.[drizzle] Batteries are more powerful and reliable than ever, and costs have come down dramatically over years. As a result, the market for electric vehicles is expected to explode to 20 million plug-in EV sales per year by 2030.To power these vehicles, millions of new battery packs will need to be built. The lithium-ion battery market is expected to grow at a 21.7% rate annually in terms of the actual energy capacity required. It was 15.9 GWh in 2015, but will be a whopping 93.1 GWh by 2024.While there are many exciting battery technologies out there, we will focus on the innards of lithium-ion batteries as they are expected to make up the vast majority of the total rechargeable battery market for the near future.Each lithium-ion cell contains three major parts:1) Anode (natural or synthetic graphite)2) Electrolyte (lithium salts3) Cathode (differing formulations)While the anode and electrolytes are pretty straightforward as far as lithium-ion technology goes, it is the cathode where most developments are being made.Lithium isn’t the only metal that goes into the cathode – other metals like cobalt, manganese, aluminum, and nickel are also used in different formulations. Here’s four cathode chemistries, the metal proportions (excluding lithium), and an example of what they are used for:While manganese and aluminum are important for lithium-ion cathodes, they are also cheaper metals with giant markets. This makes them fairly easy to procure for battery manufacturers.Lithium, graphite, and cobalt, are all much smaller and less-established markets – and each has supply concerns that remain unanswered:Meanwhile, in the United States, cobalt hasn’t been mined for 40 years and the country produced zero tonnes of graphite in 2015. There is a lithium operation near the Tesla Gigafactory 1 site but it only produces 1,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide per year.To meet its goal of a 100% North American raw materials supply chain, Tesla needs new resources to be discovered and extracted from the U.S., Canada, or Mexico.While all sorts of supply questions exist for these energy metals, the demand situation is much more straightforward.Consumers are demanding more batteries, and each battery is made up of raw materials like cobalt, graphite, and lithium.Cobalt:Today, about 40% of cobalt is used to make rechargeable batteries. By 2019, it’s expected that 55% of total cobalt demand will go to the cause.In fact, many analysts see an upcoming bull market in cobalt.“In many ways, the cobalt industry has the most fragile supply structure of all battery raw materials.” – Andrew Miller, Benchmark Mineral IntelligenceGraphite:There is 54kg of graphite in every battery anode of a Tesla Model S (85kWh).Benchmark Mineral Intelligence forecasts that the battery anode market for graphite (natural and synthetic) will at least triple in size from 80,000 tonnes in 2015 to at least 250,000 tonnes by the end of 2020.Lithium:Goldman Sachs estimates that a Tesla Model S with a 70kWh battery uses 63 kilograms of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) – more than the amount of lithium in 10,000 cell phones.Further, for every 1% increase in battery electric vehicle (BEV) market penetration, there is an increase in lithium demand by around 70,000 tonnes LCE/year.Lithium prices have recently spiked, but they may begin sliding in 2019 if more supply comes online.Sourcing the raw materials for lithium-ion batteries will be critical for our energy mix.But, the future is also bright for many other battery technologies that could help in solving our most pressing energy issues.Part 5 of The Battery Series will look at the newest technologies in the battery sector.By Jeff Desjardins, Visual Capitalist[/drizzle]
